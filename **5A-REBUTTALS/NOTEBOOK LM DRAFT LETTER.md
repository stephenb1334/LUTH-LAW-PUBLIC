I. Opening Statement

This comprehensive response serves as a formal and final communication to Mr. Luther J. Rollins, Jr., concerning the ongoing dispute related to the tenancy at 2649 Tifton St. S., Gulfport, FL 3371112. This letter addresses not only the initial "Notice of Intention to Impose Claim on Security Deposit" dated October 1, 20243456, but also his subsequent letter dated November 8, 2024, and all prior communications789. My objective is to provide an exceptionally detailed legal and factual basis for my demands and for my rejection of your insufficient settlement offer8. This response outlinesç the numerous and severe breaches of Florida law and the associated financial and emotional damages I have incurred8101112. This communication should be considered as the final opportunity to resolve this matter before I pursue litigation, file complaints with relevant regulatory bodies, and report these violations to the appropriate professional bar associations1013141516.

I will not restate the contents of prior, shorter letters101112. Instead, I will expand extensively on each violation, ensuring there can be no misunderstanding as to the gravity and scope of your conduct101112. My intent is to leave no doubt as to the legal grounds for my claims, the evidentiary support I possess, and the ample remedies and damages I am prepared to seek if we cannot reach a fair and lawful resolution promptly101112. I am fully prepared to pursue judicial intervention and regulatory oversight if you refuse to settle on fair terms10.

Your previous proposal of $2,000—split between a partial deposit refund and a token amount for personal property—is patently unacceptable8101112. It fails entirely to acknowledge the scale of your misconduct, the severity of my damages, and the extensive legal liabilities you now face101112. Given the extensive documentation I have compiled and the clear violations of Florida law, it is evident that Florida courts would be well within their authority to award me far greater sums, including but not limited to, the full return of my security deposit, compensation for the converted personal property, statutory damages, treble damages, punitive damages, emotional distress damages and attorney’s fees10131415.... Moreover, your professional standing as an attorney will not shield you from disciplinary scrutiny101112. In fact, it enhances my case for demonstrating that your misconduct is not due to ignorance but stems from a deliberate choice to flout well-established legal standards101112. This deliberate disregard for Florida's landlord-tenant statutes and your misrepresentations regarding my personal property and your own conduct constitutes bad faith, thereby compounding your liability71821. Your actions indicate a clear pattern of negligence, misrepresentation, and a refusal to comply with both your contractual obligations and the state laws designed to protect tenants21.

Luther J. Rollins, Jr. Amarlu Enterprises 231 Government Ave. S.W., #3097 Hickory, NC 28603

RE: Response to Your November 8, 2024 Letter Regarding Security Deposit and Personal Property

Dear Mr. Rollins,

This letter is a formal response to your letter dated November 8, 2024, regarding the property located at 2649 Tifton St. S., Gulfport, FL. After a detailed review of your correspondence and actions throughout our landlord-tenant relationship, I find that your response fails to meet the statutory requirements under Florida law, includes multiple misrepresentations, and ignores material facts raised in my tenant dispute letter. I write to clarify the critical issues, provide legal context, and restate my demands12.

Introduction

Your November 8, 2024, letter and your settlement offer of $2,000—split between an arbitrary partial refund of my security deposit and a negligible amount for the personal property you withheld—are both legally insufficient and profoundly insulting34. It is unfortunate that I even have to write this letter, but it appears necessary to remind you of the law, or perhaps re-educate you about these laws, which is both remarkable and disheartening considering your profession as a licensed attorney34.

I. Failure to Comply with Florida Statute §83.49(3) Regarding Security Deposit

Your initial "Notice of Intention to Impose Claim on Security Deposit" dated October 1, 2024, failed to comply with Florida Statute §83.49(3)5678.... Florida law mandates that a landlord must provide a written notice by certified mail that includes5:

1.

A specific, itemized claim against the security deposit.

2.

Detailed reasoning for any deductions5.

Your initial letter failed to provide the legally required detail and reasoning, relying instead on vague and unsupported allegations511. Your subsequent letter of November 8, 2024, merely states that you possess evidence (e.g., photos, receipts, and witness accounts) but fails to include this evidence511. As such, I remain unable to evaluate or dispute your claims effectively, which is a violation of my rights under Florida law5. If you truly possess the evidence you claim, you must provide it in full, including512:

●

Itemized lists of damages and associated costs.

●

Copies of all photos, receipts, and witness statements referenced512.

The burden of proof rests squarely with you, and I will not accept unsupported assertions512. Your notice also used future tense language, stating that "extensive cleaning will be required" and implying that repairs will be necessary6. This use of future tense is improper under Florida law, which requires that a landlord provide actual costs incurred, not speculative future expenses6. Furthermore, the property was listed for rent and available for viewings as of October 4, 2024, suggesting that any necessary cleaning or repairs were either minimal or had already been completed6.

II. Unlawful Retention and Conversion of Personal Property

In your response, you attempt to shift the burden of proof regarding the alleged abandonment of my personal property5. Under Fla. Stat. §715.104, landlords must5:

1.

Provide tenants with written notice of any personal property left behind, specifying the items and offering a reasonable time frame for retrieval.

2.

Take no action to convert or dispose of personal property without first adhering to these statutory requirements5.

You failed to follow these obligations5. Instead of notifying me or providing a written inventory of items left behind, you now claim uncertainty as to the presence of specific items, including the Weber grill that I explicitly identified in my prior correspondence5. Further, your attempts to market the property for rent using amenities—including "barbecue" references—only underscore your failure to handle my personal property lawfully578910. If my property has been converted or disposed of without proper notice, this constitutes conversion under Florida law51013. Your allegations that items on my “Addendum B” list were delivered after the lease term are entirely false578910. I have shipment records confirming that all deliveries occurred prior to the lease’s expiration on August 31, 20245. If you continue to dispute this, I demand that you provide evidence to substantiate your claims5. The fact that you are offering $500 for the personal property can serve as an implicit acknowledgment of liability78910....

III. Breach of Warranty of Habitability and Negligence

Your letter’s focus on emotional sentiments rather than substantive legal issues is particularly troubling in light of your negligence in addressing safety concerns during the lease term5. You were notified of a break-in at the property on March 26, 2024, during which an intruder entered through a deteriorated, unsecured fence gate5789.... Despite verbal discussions in which you acknowledged the need for metal gates, you failed to take action5789.... Additionally, your refusal to allow me to install adequate security cameras—despite this being a common practice among neighboring properties—further exemplifies your disregard for tenant safety5789.... This negligence contributed to the escalation of my PTSD, which has been documented by my therapist5789.... Your failure to address these critical safety concerns constitutes a breach of the implied warranty of habitability under Fla. Stat. §83.515. You also ignored a maintenance request for a clogged kitchen sink, further demonstrating your negligence78910.

IV. Misrepresentation and Ethical Concerns

You use the email address "luther2law@gmail.com", which creates the impression of being a practicing attorney78910. This could be a misrepresentation78910. If you are not a practicing attorney, any claims you made while appearing to be one would constitute misrepresentation7891018. Furthermore, as a landlord, you are required to inform me of the financial institution in the state of Florida that my security deposit was being held at, and whether it was interest-bearing or not, with interest accrued being due to me should it be interest-bearing78910.... This should have been stated in the first 30 days of the lease16192021. Since I have never been told how many properties you have in the state of Florida, nor was I informed about my security deposit as to where it was being held and related details, I cannot determine your status as a landlord in the state16192021.

V. Harassment and Emotional Distress

Your repeated, unsolicited communications—despite my requests for written correspondence only—intensified my pre-existing PTSD78910.... This behavior is consistent with harassment under Florida Statute §784.048, which prohibits conduct causing substantial emotional distress without legitimate purpose2223.

VI. Refutation of Your Claims

I am aware that you have stated, "I have a copy of the written lease signed by you"24. This is a redundant statement, as I also possess a copy, and it does not provide any additional support for your position24. You also stated, "I have a copy of the inventory signed by Melissa when you moved in"24. This statement is misleading and invalid for several reasons24:

●

The inventory list was collected by Zach, and I never received a fully executed copy with signatures on both sides and attached as an addendum to the lease24.

●

The lease clearly states that the lease includes use of your property, personal property, and furnishings24. This would have been a good place to reference the inventory list as an addendum24.

●

During my move-out process, I never had an inventory list to reference24. If you had been more organized, that inventory list would have included dollar amounts per inventory item that you could point to if they were missing when I moved out and the lease concluded24.

●

Your claim should have been accompanied by the inventory list, highlighting the specific items that are gone and how they aggregate to the total dollar amount that you believe should be withheld from the security deposit24.

VII. Demand for Full Compensation

Your arbitrary settlement offer of $1,500 of the security deposit and $500 for personal property is unacceptable5142526. I am demanding full compensation for the damages you have caused514152526. As such, I demand the following:

1.

Full Refund of Security Deposit: $4,500514152526.

2.

Compensation for Converted Personal Property: $4,210.625141523.... 3. Reimbursement of Lease Payments: $45,000, calculated as 10 months x $4,500 per month. 4. Pet Deposit: $500 5. Total Settlement Amount: $54,210.62.

This total amount reflects the direct financial losses I have incurred due to your statutory violations, negligence, and misrepresentations. I will also pursue statutory and treble damages where applicable13172227. While punitive damages can be challenging to prove, your actions, particularly as a lawyer, including your repeated neglect of safety, maintenance, bad faith, conversion of property, coercive abuse, and misrepresentation of the law, demonstrate a pattern of misconduct that warrants the pursuit of maximum penalties78910....

VIII. Legal Action

If you do not agree to the full settlement amount of $54,210.62 within 15 days of the date of this letter, I will pursue all available legal remedies in Circuit Court in the State of Florida1328293031. This will include claims for statutory and treble damages, attorney’s fees, court costs, and punitive damages13172227.

IX. Preservation of Evidence

I require that you preserve all communication records, including text messages, voicemails, emails, and any other correspondence related to this matter161925. This obligation extends to your proxy, Zach Steinberger, and it would be unlawful to tamper with, delete, or expunge this evidence161925.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]

Explanation and Reasoning:

This detailed response letter is crafted to be aggressive and assertive, reflecting the tenant's determination to fight for their rights5132532. Here’s a breakdown of the reasoning:

●

Formal Tone: The language is precise, legalistic, and devoid of emotional appeal, focusing on statutory violations and factual misrepresentations52532.

●

Detailed Statutory References: The letter consistently cites specific Florida Statutes, demonstrating knowledge of the law and holding the landlord accountable1567....

●

Refutation of Landlord's Claims: Each of the landlord's claims and actions is addressed head-on, pointing out inconsistencies, errors, and legal violations5678....

●

Emphasis on Burden of Proof: The letter repeatedly reminds the landlord that the burden of proof is on him to justify withholding the security deposit and that his claims must be supported by evidence, not speculation561225.

●

Aggressive Demands: The letter demands not only the return of the security deposit and compensation for personal property but also reimbursement of the full lease amount, explicitly stating the intent to pursue legal action and maximum penalties if these demands are not met514152526.

●

Punitive Damages: The letter emphasizes the possibility of punitive damages, noting the landlord's profession as a lawyer and pattern of bad faith13172227.

●

Preservation of Evidence: The letter explicitly requires that the landlord preserve all communication records, further demonstrating the tenant's intention to build a strong legal case161925.

●

Additional Damages: The demand for the full lease amount (10 months x $4,500 per month = $45,000) is an aggressive attempt to leverage the landlord's misconduct and is a novel approach that seeks additional compensation beyond the standard security deposit and property damage claims. The tenant is also demanding the return of the pet deposit which they claim is owed to them514152526.

This letter is designed to be a strong legal challenge that will set the stage for potential litigation in Florida Circuit Court, should the landlord not comply with the tenant’s demands.
