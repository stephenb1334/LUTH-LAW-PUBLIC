Full claims list


SECURITY DEPOSIT MISMANAGEMENT: IMPROPER NOTICE
	•	Rollins failed to provide a legally compliant “Notice of Intention to Impose Claim on Security Deposit” as required by Fla. Stat. §83.49(3)(a). The notice lacked specific itemization, detailed reasons for deductions, and supporting documentation, such as receipts or photos. The use of vague language like “damage to walls” and “missing items” without specifics renders the notice insufficient.

SECURITY DEPOSIT MISMANAGEMENT: INCORRECT ADDRESS
	•	The notice included an incorrect zip code for the response address, delaying the tenant’s ability to respond within the statutory timeframe.

SECURITY DEPOSIT MISMANAGEMENT: FAILURE TO DISCLOSE
	•	Rollins failed to disclose the financial institution holding the security deposit, whether it was interest-bearing, or if he owns over five properties in Florida as required by law.

SECURITY DEPOSIT MISMANAGEMENT: UNLAWFUL DEDUCTIONS
	•	Rollins attempted to use future expenses and speculative damages as a basis for security deposit deductions, which is not permitted under Florida law. He also failed to provide a detailed breakdown of individual costs, making it impossible to determine if amounts claimed were reasonable.

SECURITY DEPOSIT MISMANAGEMENT: WITHHOLDING WITHOUT JUSTIFICATION
	•	Rollins withheld the entire security deposit of $4,500 without providing proper justification or evidence of damage.

SECURITY DEPOSIT MISMANAGEMENT: FAILURE TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE IN SUBSEQUENT LETTERS
	•	Despite claiming in his second letter that he has ample photos, witnesses, and documentation to support his claims, Rollins again failed to produce any such evidence. Even after being given a second opportunity to supply detailed information, he did not present the necessary proof, suggesting bad faith and an unwillingness to be transparent.

UNLAWFUL RETENTION & CONVERSION OF PERSONAL PROPERTY: FAILURE TO PROVIDE NOTICE
	•	Rollins did not provide the required written notice to the tenant regarding personal property left behind, violating Fla. Stat. §715.104. He failed to specify the items left behind and offer a reasonable timeframe for retrieval.

UNLAWFUL RETENTION & CONVERSION OF PERSONAL PROPERTY: CONVERSION OF PROPERTY
	•	Rollins unlawfully retained the tenant’s personal property, including a Weber grill, and used it to market the rental property, which constitutes conversion under Florida law.

UNLAWFUL RETENTION & CONVERSION OF PERSONAL PROPERTY: SHIFTING BURDEN OF PROOF
	•	Rollins attempted to shift the burden of proof to the tenant by requesting evidence that the tenant’s personal property was left on the premises, when the burden is on the landlord to prove that the property was not there or that it was abandoned.

UNLAWFUL RETENTION & CONVERSION OF PERSONAL PROPERTY: MISREPRESENTATION OF ABANDONMENT
	•	Rollins used a partial quote of a text message to suggest the tenant abandoned the property, which is a misrepresentation and omission of the full context.

LANDLORD NEGLIGENCE & BREACH OF HABITABILITY: FAILURE TO MAINTAIN PREMISES
	•	Rollins neglected maintenance issues, such as a severely clogged kitchen sink, despite being notified. This forced the tenant to resolve the issue himself.

LANDLORD NEGLIGENCE & BREACH OF HABITABILITY: FAILURE TO ADDRESS SECURITY CONCERNS
	•	Rollins failed to address security concerns after a break-in, despite the tenant’s requests for improved gates and security cameras. He acknowledged the need for a secure gate but then reversed his commitment. He also limited the tenant’s ability to install security cameras.

LANDLORD NEGLIGENCE & BREACH OF HABITABILITY: BREACH OF IMPLIED WARRANTY
	•	By failing to address the security concerns and maintenance issues, Rollins breached the implied warranty of habitability under Fla. Stat. §83.51.

LANDLORD MISCONDUCT & HARASSMENT: UNWANTED COMMUNICATION
	•	Rollins engaged in frequent unsolicited communications, including phone calls and text messages, after being asked to communicate only through certified mail, which constitutes harassment. This disregard for the tenant’s request and the use of unsolicited phone calls exacerbated the tenant’s PTSD.

LANDLORD MISCONDUCT & HARASSMENT: MISREPRESENTATION OF LEGAL PROCESS
	•	Rollins attempted to coerce the tenant into a phone call by implying the law requires them to be amicable, which is false.

LANDLORD MISCONDUCT & HARASSMENT: EMOTIONAL DISTRESS
	•	Rollins’ actions caused significant emotional distress to the tenant, exacerbating his pre-existing PTSD.

PROFESSIONAL MISCONDUCT & ETHICAL VIOLATIONS: MISREPRESENTATION AS A LAWYER
	•	Rollins’ use of the email address “[luther2law@gmail.com](mailto:luther2law@gmail.com)” implies he is acting as a lawyer in this matter, potentially constituting misrepresentation. This could be an attempt to shield himself from scrutiny while retaining the benefits of appearing to be a lawyer.

PROFESSIONAL MISCONDUCT & ETHICAL VIOLATIONS: VIOLATIONS OF FLORIDA BAR RULES
	•	As an attorney, Rollins’ actions may violate the Florida Bar Rules of Professional Conduct, specifically Rule 4-8.4(c) (prohibiting conduct involving dishonesty or misrepresentation) and Rule 4-8.4(d) (prohibiting conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice).

LACK OF TRANSPARENCY & BAD FAITH: FAILURE TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE
	•	Despite claiming to possess photos, receipts, and witness accounts, Rollins failed to provide any supporting documentation to substantiate his claims, even after multiple opportunities.

LACK OF TRANSPARENCY & BAD FAITH: ARBITRARY SETTLEMENT OFFER
	•	Rollins made an arbitrary settlement offer of $2,000, which lacks any legal basis and does not address the full extent of his liabilities.

ALLEGED PROPERTY DAMAGE: DAMAGE TO WALLS
	•	The landlord claims damage to walls without specifying the nature, location, or extent of the damage. The tenant denies causing any damage beyond normal wear and tear, which tenants are not responsible for under Florida law.

ALLEGED PROPERTY DAMAGE: REMOVAL OF FIXTURES
	•	The landlord claims the tenant removed wood cabinets, shelving, and counters without prior written consent. The tenant acknowledges removing temporary fixtures installed for organization but was prepared to restore the premises or compensate, but his attempts to communicate were ignored.

ALLEGED PROPERTY DAMAGE: EXCESSIVE GARBAGE
	•	The landlord claims there was excessive garbage and trash left on the premises. The tenant explains that any trash was due to a delay in garbage collection caused by a severe storm and that all trash was placed in the designated area.

ALLEGED PROPERTY DAMAGE: SPOILED FOOD
	•	The landlord claims spoiled food was left in the refrigerator. The tenant responds that any remaining food items were minimal and did not cause damage and that minor cleaning is considered normal turnover.

ALLEGED PROPERTY DAMAGE: MISSING/DAMAGED ITEMS
	•	The landlord alleges missing and damaged artwork, furnishings, and housewares. However, this claim is unenforceable due to the lack of an initial, detailed inventory list.

ALLEGED ABANDONMENT OF PROPERTY: MISREPRESENTATION OF TEXT MESSAGE
	•	The landlord attempts to mischaracterize a text message from the tenant as an indication that he had abandoned his personal property, but the tenant’s response clarifies the full context of the message, showing intent to retrieve his belongings.

FAILURE TO MAKE REPAIRS: TENANT’S PROACTIVE ACTIONS
	•	The tenant is accused of not making necessary repairs to the property. However, the tenant was forced to take on these repairs due to the landlord’s negligence in the first place, such as the clogged sink, making him justifiably responsible for some issues that would have been the landlord’s responsibility if he had acted proactively.

LANDLORD VIOLATION OF STATUTE 83.67
	•	Landlords are prohibited from converting tenant property for personal use or failing to notify tenants in writing about the status of abandoned personal property. Rollins’ actions are in direct violation of this statute.

LANDLORD VIOLATION OF STATUTE 715.109
	•	A landlord who does not comply with this part shall be liable to the former tenant for actual damages or three months’ rent, whichever is greater, and costs of the action.

CLAIMS LETTER ISSUES: VAGUE AND LACKING
	•	The landlord’s original claim on the security deposit was vague, lacked itemized specifics, failed to include photographic evidence, and provided an incorrect ZIP Code, causing delivery delays.

CLAIMS LETTER ISSUES: USE OF FUTURE TENSE
	•	The landlord’s notice uses speculative language about future costs and implies that repairs will be necessary. Florida law requires landlords to provide actual costs incurred, not speculative future expenses.

CLAIMS LETTER ISSUES: ABSENCE OF SUPPORTING EVIDENCE
	•	The landlord’s notice fails to include any supporting documentation such as photographs, receipts, or invoices to substantiate the claims.

CLAIMS LETTER ISSUES: NO BASELINE FOR COMPARISON
	•	Without an initial, itemized inventory, it is impossible to substantiate claims of missing or damaged items. There is no baseline against which to compare the condition of the property at the end of the tenancy.

CLAIMS LETTER ISSUES: UNREASONABLE ACCOUNTABILITY
	•	Holding the tenant accountable for items that were never clearly defined or documented at the start of the tenancy is unreasonable and potentially unlawful.
