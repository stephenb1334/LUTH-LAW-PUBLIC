# Timeline of Zach's Communication Failures and Legal Implications
## PTSD Disclosure & Extended Stay (September 2, 2024)
### Tenant’s PTSD Disclosure
#### Tenant, Stephen Boerner, disclosed his PTSD to Zach Steinberger via text.

#### PTSD resulted from a March 26 home invasion at the rental property.

#### The landlord failed to secure the property post-invasion, worsening tenant's condition.

### Extended Stay Justification
#### Severe weather and canceled moving services forced a stay beyond lease end.

#### Zach either failed to communicate the tenant's PTSD and extended stay reasons or did so but the landlord ignored it.

## Request for Property Retrieval (September 3–4, 2024)
### Itemized Request for Personal Property
#### Tenant requested retrieval of personal items left at property, such as artwork and a grill.

#### Zach either failed to forward the list to the landlord or delayed it, hindering retrieval efforts.

### Legal Implications of Communication Failure
#### If Zach Withheld Information: This breach of duty affects the tenant’s rights under Florida statutes.

#### If the Landlord Knew: The landlord is legally responsible as the agent's knowledge is imputed to them.

## Impact on Deposit Withholding
### Breach of Duty
#### Zach’s failure to communicate undermines the landlord’s legal basis for withholding the security deposit.

#### PTSD and related circumstances do not justify retaining the deposit or denying property retrieval.

### Statutory Noncompliance & Bad Faith
#### Failure to address the tenant’s requests can lead to claims of negligence, bad faith, and statutory violations.

#### Liability Allocation: Zach shares responsibility if he withheld communication; the landlord holds ultimate responsibility.
