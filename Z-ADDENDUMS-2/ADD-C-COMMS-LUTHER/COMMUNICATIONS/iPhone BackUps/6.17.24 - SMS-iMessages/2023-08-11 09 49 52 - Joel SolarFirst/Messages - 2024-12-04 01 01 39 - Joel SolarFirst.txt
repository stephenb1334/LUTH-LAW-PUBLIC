Loving all the interviews being setup. For the next wave, we need to get a system in place so you and the applicant can see what my availability is and pick a time without the back and forth

Spoke with Javis and Jared so far. Juliette is a 330.

I liked Javis. I‚Äôm on the fence. But I LOVED Jared. That dude is a rockstar and going to make a push for him.

Nevan has his 3 interviews with your referrals tomorrow. I believe we will see 2 in the august class and depending on Nevan‚Äôs feedback on Javis, we will likely push him to September but only bc we may opt to have less reps come on board in august. I‚Äôm an advocate for ensuring we have an abundance of leads first and a structure in place to train reps on building their own businesses within Solar first (which I want to work with you on and build with you). The last thing I want is too many reps and we haven‚Äôt scaled our lead mechanisms to support each rep. 

Spent a full day with Nevan and Derek today. Amazing discussions and some really good planning sessions that wed love you input on. 

And their feedback about you is superb. Glad to be on board with you man.

Hope you dont mind a weekend text brotha! Just getting some work done and wanted to keep in touch on new hires.

Daniel straight up hung up on me. I tried him twice, texted him. Nothing.

Jared starts in August. Austin starts in August. 

Sarah is pushing to September due to some immigration/legalization paperwork she is waiting for I believe. 

Javis missed Nevan‚Äôs call this past Thursday. It was Prime week so he couldn‚Äôt pick up. He just texted Nevan at my request asking for another time to speak

----------------------------------------------------
Joel SolarFirst
2023-07-15 10:54:43 to Joel SolarFirst - Delivered

August will have 2 new hires (Austin/Jared). Sarah moving to September gives me breathing room for lead mechanism, onboarding, and training to improve by September class.

I don‚Äôt mind at all brother! 

This all sounds great. I‚Äôm not upset in the slightest. Not to sound like I sit on a high horse or anything, but the weak will weed themselves out.

The prime week makes sense. I even took advantage of that. üòÖ

I think what we put in place for next month is perfect. Let‚Äôs get a couple go getters in the seats and get Solar First‚Äôs name out there!

Call felt solid right?

I appreciate your comments on the call as well‚Ä¶.And the support overall. 

It‚Äôs all just a talking duck until it‚Äôs not so less quacking and now we execute. 

Keep me honest. Keep me informed. I am fully onboard to making that plan a reality. Supporting you. 

I just need the buy in. Thank you brotha

Happy Sunday brotha. I‚Äôm also reading this book and screening it to see if I want to introduce it. It is 30 pages long and really compliments Think and Go Rich. Super easy read and drives home a lot. Derek has a copy of this book along with the other books he‚Äôs storing for new hires and what not. Try and grab the last copy he has and let me know if you think it‚Äôs helpful and if you think others would benefit. Enjoy the day
