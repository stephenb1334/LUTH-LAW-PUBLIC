My buddy who I am with just starts laughing. I turn and simple say, yeah I got a lot of that one. The dude goes wow nice shot man. We get down there, and he actually goes and checks to my ball to see if it was his….That was the last time I heard about his driving all round. Oh, and I won the long drive.",,
