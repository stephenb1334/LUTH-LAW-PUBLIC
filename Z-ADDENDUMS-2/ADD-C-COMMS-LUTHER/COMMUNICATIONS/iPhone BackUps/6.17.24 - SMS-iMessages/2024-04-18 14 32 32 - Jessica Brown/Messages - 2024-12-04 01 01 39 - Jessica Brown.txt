I love how quickly you had that info! You're like me haha

I'm going to triple check to make sure what we have is 100 percent compatible. I will get back to you but it looks good first glance. We have a great system engineer I prefer to check with first

I can share on my end as well. Also being new to the area I could learn from you. 

And in fun news...we just signed a lease. It was a real rush this past week as we needed an 11/1 move in date and found the perfect spot in Gulfport

Hi Jessica, I'm with my engineer now and we are continuing to think through battery options for your existing system. 

It really comes down to your goals. Can you clarify the goal for us?

Is the goal...

To add security / peace-of-mind via a constant power supply when the grid goes down? Meaning, your existing panels would power your home as they do now, but would also power a battery backup system should the grid go down. 

Or

To reduce the excess energy you're producing that is currently sent back to the grid/power company (by storing excess energy in a battery on premise to then use during the nights or evenings of the day it was produced by your panels) - This option would not allow for power if the grid goes down

The second one is confusing I think. Basically there are two battery directions to consider. 

The first is for families that want power outage security so their most critical appliances and rooms are secured with ongoing power during outages 

The second scenario is a battery option that does not supply ongoing power if the power goes out, it just stores your energy produced in a on-site battery to use when the panels are not producing energy 



----------------------------------------------------

2023-10-26 13:39:39 from Jessica Brown (+18139225821) - Read

Good question.   Interested in both I guess, but mostly the storing the energy ww produce.

Hi Jessica, we had an Angi's List lead come in down in Naples and it booked for 3pm tomorrow. I apologize but I'm wondering if you can meet at 9-9:15 tomorrow morning instead or Thursday after the RGA Clearwater meeting perhaps if you're going

Good morning!
Tomorrow morning 9:15 works great.  I'll be at the morning mtg at the Hangar so I can just pop over to Starbucks after.

I have a conflict on Thursday this week so I won't be able to make that mtg.

Ok sounds good. I have a networking meeting that ends at 9am at St Pete Yacht club downtown st pete near the pier. I'm joining that and they asked me to stay after for a quick interview as part of my application. They said it will be quick but to be safe can we go with 9:30am?
