It really depends on when in September you are looking for as I work on first come first serve scheduling basis. I can tell you at this time I’m at capacity the weekend of 9/23 and have a bridal shower in Maryland September 18th and trying to keep that Sunday low as my brother will be coming over to help with the dogs that afternoon and I don’t want to overwhelm him. And I’m off and away September 30-October 2nd for the bachelorette to go with the bridal shower lol,,
