Felt like it was coming from internal building speakers within our unit but was not a fire alarm. Almost sounded like someone was pressing the front door buzzer and that was triggering it bc the noise wasn’t steady but fuckin so loud. Maybe only our unit I thought it was everyone. Also the front entrance door seems more smashed up and lock feels loose ,,

Steve here, your neighbor. 

We have to apologize for not notifying you as a courtesy earlier, but we had to move quick on leasing our condo to a young couple who started living in 4D October 1st. 

We worked with Juliana Martell (5th floor owner) to find,and fully vet, tenants and feel great with the neighbors you now have. 

We have also notified Karen who oversees the HOA from a property management perspective, so we should be in check with he terms of the HOA bylaws. 

We failed to notify you and you've likely realized you have new neighbors. Anyway, it was a pleasure meeting you and wish all the best. We now live in Florida of all places but are enjoying it. 

Should you have any issues or complaints regarding our tenants (Ethan and Katie), please let us know 

Steve & Melissa",,
