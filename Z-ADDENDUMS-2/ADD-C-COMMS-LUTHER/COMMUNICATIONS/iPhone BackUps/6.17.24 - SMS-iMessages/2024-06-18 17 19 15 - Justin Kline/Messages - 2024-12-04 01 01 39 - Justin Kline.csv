Even darker, and felt more, with good headphones and 3 minutes. 

The story revolves around a villain, who is portrayed as a true embodiment of evil. 

The story contains a fictitious background of the villain, but his character is based on a non-fictional, accurate portrayal of himself.

The villain is depicted as having a demented, immature mind that struggles to grasp reality, leading to an unseen crescendo of violence. The story focuses on how evil often wins battles, while good rarely wins the never-ending war. The villain's past is riddled with violence and a difficult childhood, which has contributed to his underdeveloped mind and inability to control his anger.

The story also tackles the inner battles that the villain faces, including his inner homoerotic urges, which are portrayed as the driving force behind his anger towards the world. The story's author uses various metaphors to highlight the inner struggles of the villain.

Overall, the story provides an interesting glimpse into the author's mental state during production and serves as a therapeutic outlet for the author's own struggles.
