This is a first-person account that is metaphorical and therapeutic, although quite dark. 

Even darker, and felt more, with good headphones and 3 minutes. 

The story revolves around a villain, who is portrayed as a true embodiment of evil. 

The story contains a fictitious background of the villain, but his character is based on a non-fictional, accurate portrayal of himself.

The villain is depicted as having a demented, immature mind that struggles to grasp reality, leading to an unseen crescendo of violence. The story focuses on how evil often wins battles, while good rarely wins the never-ending war. The villain's past is riddled with violence and a difficult childhood, which has contributed to his underdeveloped mind and inability to control his anger.

The story also tackles the inner battles that the villain faces, including his inner homoerotic urges, which are portrayed as the driving force behind his anger towards the world. The story's author uses various metaphors to highlight the inner struggles of the villain.

Overall, the story provides an interesting glimpse into the author's mental state during production and serves as a therapeutic outlet for the author's own struggles.

FYI the only thing worth spending on for you if ChatGPT monthly paid version gets you a whole lot for $20/month. I will show you where to get that value . One example of so many is you can take pictures of your handwritten notes  and upload image from your phone and it transcribes the notes then you can chat with AI about the contents and it can rewrite them, expland upon them. Etc

Also I’m gonna send you a phone recording in a bit about our conversation and will rock your brain it’s pretty cool. Coming soon teaser right here

Now to figure out how to best utilize this archive 

----------------------------------------------------
Justin Kline
2024-04-20 11:03:22 to Justin Kline - Delivered

You could use the notes app and use the camera scan feature to turn them into PDFs

She wants to move out. She wont tell me the issues. Last night i gave her my word id do anything to help. Today, shes usijg my offer for unconditional support to leverage it into me paying for a second place in St Petersburg. 

I havent replied. Im just writing this in a noted file to get it out. I need someone to tell me not to send it or to send it or to whatever. Im sharing this only with you. Please dont share or tell anyone. Christina is okay to share i understand how that works. I want Melissa to have whatever she needs. I love her and i dont know what else to do

I wouldn’t send that yet, I think it’s a great idea that your “getting it out of you” and think you should keep doing that, but I wouldn’t send it while the cut is still wide open. 

That being said, my “advice” is not going to be great because I am unsure of what has transpired with you guys recently 

I can’t emphasize enough, I’m here for you , we are actually in OCMD and would be happy to talk late night as well and can sit outside, totally up to you.
