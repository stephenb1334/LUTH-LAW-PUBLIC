Just wanted to confirm with the new keeper rule, that was meant to exclude players that were drafted in the beginning of season, otherwise it would be way to hard to keep up with, along with many other reasons. Only players that were newly off waiver wire.

Morris just picked up a Breece Hall. I'm assuming he did it because of the new rule. You should probably clear that up for the group that it can't be a drafted player.
