Hunter,2022-07-21 18:53:37,,,,SMS,Outgoing,,,Sent,,,"Hi Hunter, apologies for the long delay in responding. My initial interest was learning more about how the board worked, how I might get involved, and meeting others in the building. We will be away for the next ten days or so...might not be able to meet up short term unless it's tomorrow afternoon or evening otherwise text or phone is cool. Happy to host you and show you around the new place ",,

Steve here, your neighbor. 

We have to apologize for not notifying you as a courtesy but we had to move quick on leasing our condo to a young couple who started living in 4D October 1st. 

We worked with Juliana Martell to find,and fully vet, tenants and feel great with the neighbors you now have. 

We have also notified Karen so we should be in check with he terms of the HOA bylaws. 

We failed to notify you and you've likely realized you have new neighbors. Anyway, it was a pleasure meeting you and wish all the best. We now live in Florida of all places but are enjoying it. 

Should you have any issues or complaints regarding our tenants (Ethan and Katie), please let us know 

Steve & Melissa  ",,
