Sorry to bother you on the weekend (This is Melissa Bemer and Steve Boerner from 4C/D). We wanted to update you that we just scheduled for Best Choice Plumbing to work on our unit Tuesday 8/2 from 8-9am and we need the water shut off during this time for a bit if possible. We also left a voicemail for Karen because we know you want to let the rest of the tenants know ASAP. If there is any issue with being able to get the water shut off Tuesday please let us know. Thank you so much and hope you have a great afternoon! ",,
