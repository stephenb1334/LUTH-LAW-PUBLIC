Good morning. 

Steve and I like to sit and talk about the AI possibilities, Thursday or Friday next week with you for your company.

First sit down is really learning about scope of what the company does and needs, and figure out how we can help. From there you can determine how or if it‚Äôs beneficial to sit down with your company‚Äôs decision makers.

When you have day/time, we'll make it happen. Can meet at LT or anywhere. Maybe hour of your time üòÅ

Been thinking through your HOA Ai meeting stuff. 

This doesn‚Äôt address the near term challenges you mentioned really (like the AI skepticism colliding with regulatory privacy recs, etc.)‚Ä¶‚Äù

but am wondering if you‚Äôve already roadmapped the merge point of integrating an already super mature mind mapping tech as one of the multiple, templetized HOA specific outputs after a call concludes and the ai transcribes, summarizes, formats to a, b, c needs of your market 

Willing to bet it‚Äôs not a feature in super high demand given what I heard from you but just a first blush on your market there 

assuming you do have it mapped to converge given y‚Äôall have the unique market position with an established mind mapping capability . Now I‚Äôm remembering you mentioned your AEs are ready to upsell, renew, etc so sounds like it

Curious if the HOA market has shown interest in the AI meetings producing HOA mind map templates from the minute notes in general as it leads me to another idea to share  

----------------------------------------------------
Jeremy Dolan & John Roman
2024-04-11 17:23:00 to Jeremy Dolan & John Roman - Sent

And/or‚Ä¶another feature‚Ä¶

integrating a non profit board calendar for example to the mind map output ‚Ä¶

if you turn on task management within mind maps 

‚Ä¶and reminders too it can all go to a shared HOA calendar integration where they can individually integrate their own calendars to the platform calendar if they want ‚Ä¶

But alternatively they could de-risk and subscribe to a single board shared calendar that acts more like an private RSS feed just by subscribing to it to ease up the regulatory  concerns.
