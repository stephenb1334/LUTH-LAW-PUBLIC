I have a request into the building superintendent, Steve, for advice on best steps to take regarding the mice you encountered . Wanted to keep you posted. We never experience mice while living there so I haven't solved for it yet. New to me. So I'm learning what other units have done to provide the best recommendations to you both, or to learn about what we can possibly do to pay to service the issue. I'm unsure what works and what doesn't so I'm learning quick and will communicate as I hear. I understand mice are NOT fun to have around so we are 100 percent empathetic on that. Any new updates on new mice sightings or captures with the traps you set ?",,
Katie 246 Old City Tenant & Ethan Witherup & Melissa,2024-03-22 17:41:47,,,,SMS,Outgoing,,,Sent,,,"Hello, the superintendent said he can stop by Monday afternoon or anytime Wednesday of next week. 

The solution he presented had some options but he will review with you both and ultimately you have the choice. 

First, there is no fume extermination option similar to last time with the bugs we had. 

There are the options of putting traditional mouse traps in strategic places that Steve can help with deciding upon (once he learns more while on site next week).

There is also the option he recommended which is to put poison pellets in strategic places where the mouse would die within 24 hours after consuming. 

Note the option poison means the mouse dies after it has digested the poison where the body may not be findable, nor removable. This could result in the smell of a dead mouse  for a week or less unlike mouse traps that would enable the dead mouse to be removed. That is assuming the mouse dies in an area behind the immediate walls. The superintendent believes they are coming from upstairs and confirm are rare. There is a chance it dies and never returns and you never smell it. 

You could also take the additional option to knock on the doors of the tenants above you, and see if they have an issue or could shed some to help guide us. 

My recommendation is the poison, but I don't have a lot of experience with removing mice so I want to give you best options and let you decide and we will schedule whatever is best",,

Thank you so much for following up with this so much. I know it's not great to hear! Monday afternoon works for me for Steve to come by.

I think going with poison traps would be okay. Right now we have some set up in a few cabinets. We cleared out the kitchen two days ago and  just noticed one dropping since then.
We can check with the tenants above us and see if they've had any problems. It would be so weird if it was just our unit. We'll keep in touch and let you know any updates. Super weird and hopefully it's just a rare random thing! ",,

 'I tried the oven this morning and it worked fine, a couple weird beeps but it got the job done.' We held off after the handyman made some tweaks. as for the dryer, are you routinely cleaning the dryer's lint trap? it's likely something else wrong but just confirming. i'll call steve the handyman later this morning and set up a drop by asap for both issues to get the assessment from him and move forward with repairs quickly",,

Also, do we have your permission for Steve to enter the condo without anyone being home?
