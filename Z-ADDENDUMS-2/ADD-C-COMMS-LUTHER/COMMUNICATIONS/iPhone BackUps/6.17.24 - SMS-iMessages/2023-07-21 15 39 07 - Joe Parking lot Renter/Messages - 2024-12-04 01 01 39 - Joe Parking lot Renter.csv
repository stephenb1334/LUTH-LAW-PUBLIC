It’s Joe Kohri, your parking spot renter. Is the gate not working? When I just went back to park there was one spot left and then right along the fence was open as well. Not sure if other people are parking there since it is in the up position. Thanks, 
Joe",,

If not, your car is registered now with the building. If they are actually inspecting which I doubt they will be, they will see you have the old tag and the car is approved to be there so I don’t see an issue. To ensure that, I will notify them that we are away and will replace tags soon as we are also going away for a week next week so you and I are aligned there",,
