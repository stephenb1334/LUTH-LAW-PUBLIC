I’m coming up the Bethlehem for a golf scramble this Friday. I have to bring my dog and leave her at my parents while I’m at the tournament. They live down the street from you near the new st library. 

I’m looking for someone I can pay $50 to. Would include letting her out twice. Once around 11am-1pm and again around 4-6pm while also feeding her dinner around 4-6pm.

If you’re around Friday would you be able to? If not, know anyone?",,
