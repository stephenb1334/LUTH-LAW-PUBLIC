Hi Stephen,

Mom & I are going over the Christmas schedule. Everything looks fine with the dates you sent us. 

We are hoping you‚Äôll be able to stay for early Christmas morning Santa gift opening with Bash & Rumi. 

Also, since you‚Äôre thinking of coming here some days after Christmas, we‚Äôd like to schedule a horse-drawn carriage ride for the four of us on 
Dec 29. Let us know as soon as possible, cause the rides are in high demand. 

Lastly, we are going with Sarah, Nevan & kids to NYC on Dec 28 to see the Rockettes. They‚Äôll fly home from there, so won‚Äôt be returning to Bethlehem. 
But we‚Äôll be home the evening of Dec 28.

I just spoke to Alexis, a nurse at Nurse Navigator, a division of Tampa General Hospital that helps with resources alignment, booking appointments, etc. Very nice person and eager to help. 

She is reaching out to EliteDNA, based in Largo, Florida. EliteDNA is a psychology and psychiatric clinic so they have both. She said they are very good and tend to have the earliest availability. She knows them well and is calling them this morning. I‚Äôve asked for in-person but she gave me a heads up that there will be an initial screening via Telehealth but it will be in-person thereafter. 

Alexis said she would contact me by phone and via messages in my patient portal called ‚ÄúMyChart‚Äù which I now have as an app on my phone 

I will have more details shortly.
