Don‚Äôt you love it when the debrief is as long as the sync itself? I‚Äôm around all day whenever you have a second to ring me back, I‚Äôll try again before 5:30 if I don‚Äôt hear from you

Hey Steve, had some things come up end of day and then I looked over my resume and being the perfectionist I am - decided to try and spruce it up a little more before sending it over. I‚Äôm almost finished up now, just didn‚Äôt want you to think I forgot about you!

Reply to my email tomorrow morning but only to Neil and I. Say nice to meet you and what not and provide availability. Try and get him on calendar same way you would any prospect. Don‚Äôt wait for him. He‚Äôs super busy and doesn‚Äôt mind the follow up. Worked for me

Hey! I have a meeting with Neil at 9 via Google meet!

Do you know if he‚Äôs looking to video conference or just chat by phone? He didn‚Äôt specify and I am traveling home from DC, I‚Äôd pull over and find a Starbucks if he‚Äôd like to do more than a phone call!

Secondly, and last minute advice!

Neil told me you were super sharp and impressive. He said he hasn‚Äôt formalized the hiring process for this role but it‚Äôs coming. I‚Äôm pushing him to hire an EBR sooner than he had scheduled so it won‚Äôt move fast. Keep killing it at carahsoft in the meantime. You‚Äôre top of the list once he does

I‚Äôm super flexible with a little notice, I‚Äôm in Frederick until July 1 and then I‚Äôll be in DC but regardless, I don‚Äôt mind driving up to something

It‚Äôs about 2.5 hours from my house in Frederick and about 2 hours from my new place in DC, but that‚Äôs about what I had guessed anyway thinking about trekking up to PA so I‚Äôd be game! Just would need a little notice & an early afternoon tee time üòÇ

Yes! Twice actually! Sorry I completely had forgotten you had offered to sync prior - I was likely overwhelmed thinking about moving to DC the following day, apologies nonetheless. 

I spoke to her last week for the first time and just this afternoon for a second time, both great conversations. My next step I believe was she was going to have me sync with Clayton Berry and then potentially have a discovery call where they‚Äôd have me answer some questions around how I would approach a specific contact/what questions or things I would look to leverage that were specific to their job role/environment

Ok nice. Clayton is a great guy. Really easy to talk to. Won‚Äôt be an interview really. If they are sending you to Clayton that means they like you and want you to learn about the company outside of an interview setting
