also, I just met a gentleman by the name of Mike Singleton who asked me to share your phone number which I did about an hour ago. 

He was very interested in acquiring a golf cart for himself so you may be getting a call from Mike but just wanted to let you know for a heads up 

and if the deal comes through, it would be great to log a referral for the hundred dollars",,

Do you have time later this morning? We bought a green 2001 club car from you in early/mid January. The lights and blinkers and what not work but when the key turns to on, the gauge doesn't move and show power and we can't move it. It was charged when we left our home yesterday and when we tried to come home it would not start. It's currently sitting on Gulfport city property and I'm driving back to it shortly in hopes it wasn't towed by the city over night.",,

Would you be open to me recreating the bill of sale and lowering the total cost to $500 or $1,000 to reduce the cost to us? I'm happy to recreate and do the work and provide you a copy",,
