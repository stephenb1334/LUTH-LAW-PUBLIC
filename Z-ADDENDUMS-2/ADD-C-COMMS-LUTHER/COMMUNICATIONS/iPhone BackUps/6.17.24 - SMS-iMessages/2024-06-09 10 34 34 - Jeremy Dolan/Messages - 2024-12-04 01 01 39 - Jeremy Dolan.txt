Steve - low tide . 

Really enjoyed the banter. Great convo actually. Rare meeting someone so similar. 

Also, appreciate your offer for the Tampa lawyer intro. It's in my back pocket for now. May tap you after I work through this patch depending on this or that. Nice to have tho so thank ms again. 

Hit me up whenever. Tomorrow is open. Thursday, whenever. My calendar is beautifully clear so can work around you. I can help however helping formal or informally unfolds. And I'm in the immersion phase, sandbox as a kid phase. so value to me looks different. I want the insights I'd garner. 

Will email you from my newly minted email address - steve@theaiminded.com

Steve, 

It was a pleasure to meet you as well. Rarely do I relate to people and it‚Äôs nice to have an intelligent conversation. Those are somewhat rare these days unfortunately. 

I grew up here and have a wide network of people in various categories. So don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out if you need an introduction or a reliable referral. 

I‚Äôm in the office 9-6 and usually will stop for 30-45 minutes after work for a kava. 

It was a pleasure meeting you and I wish you the best with your legal woes and hope peace can be found.

Hi Jeremy, 

you mentioned your wide network of contacts in the area. Curious if you can help us by introducing any good injury attorneys or whatever type of lawyer would handle what we just went through. 

Long story short, my wife and I had a break-in at our home here in Gulfport at 3am two nights ago. 

The guy who broke in was arrested and we are pressing charges for trespassing and attempted burglary as we found evidence he was taking stuff from one of our offices at home.  

He was only arrested because I tackled him and beat the shit out of him. Which isn‚Äôt a brag point actually the opposite it was so dangerous and we got so lucky he didn‚Äôt have a weapon. 

Our dog barking maybe saved our lives we don‚Äôt know his exact intent but he was high and drunk. 

The drunk part made it easier to fight him and thank god he didn‚Äôt have a weapon so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not proud of this or feel good in any way. I‚Äôm Highly anxious now and my back is fucked up. 

If we don‚Äôt press charges he walks free. He‚Äôs 32 and a Gulfport native having lived here his whole life. 

His name is Brian Borland. He lives with his parents at 2601 48th St S, Gulfport, FL. Do you know him?

Anyway, I can‚Äôt do much without a lawyer and wondering if you know of one that could assist us with this

Spoke to your friend. Gave good intel. He pulled a rap sheet of 40+ crimes all pointing to this guy being highly dangerous. He recommended against action to get revenge and said he has no money to take. Even suggested one move of reaching out to offer something like a gift card to stay away from us which I'm absolutely not doing but I appreciated knowing the reasons why. Just a shitty situation bc now I'm worries living where we live and I can't go after him or it's worse and this guy is clearly not right in the head after I'm seeing the full history of crimes

I‚Äôm going to Uber there tomorrow so closer the better but it doesn‚Äôt matter and maybe I can get a ride back with you. Melissa has the car tomorrow at work in Tampa so unless it‚Äôs a Golf Cart ride away, I will Uber.

For contact pro related stuff I can be more helpful just the way you phrased it earlier being ‚Äú this is the problem‚Äù or ‚Äúthis is my vision‚Äù ‚Äú is it possible‚Äù or ‚Äúcan it be fixed?‚Äù so keep planting seeds with me and they will start to sew together

My dad surprised me with a visit and we have 7:30pm reservations at Pia's. I'm currently at LT and will be here until around 7. 

For my meeting with Bruno tomorrow, my preparation is limited since he's giving me access to the data behind the executed NDA. 

To make the most of your time and perspective, it would be better to have a longer sit-down once I've gone through the data he's given me 

I'll take a week or so to review whay he provides - coming up with ideas on how to proceed and incorporate any contractual options to pitch back to him.

Time with you before that future meeting makes more sense

----------------------------------------------------
Jeremy Dolan
2024-05-04 13:00:11 to Jeremy Dolan - Read

Here are some:

TensorFlow + Django** - Great for AI-powered web apps.

PyTorch + Flask** - Ideal for AI experiments and prototyping.


Scikit-Learn + Node.js** - Perfect for ML in JavaScript apps.


MongoDB + Google Cloud AI** - Awesome for scalable apps with big unstructured data.


PostgreSQL + AWS SageMaker** - Best for enterprise apps needing robust AI.


Redis + Azure AI** - Super for high-performance apps with real-time predictions.


----------------------------------------------------
Jeremy Dolan
2024-05-04 13:03:16 to Jeremy Dolan - Read

focusing on Laravel and PHP, integrations with AI:

Laravel + TensorFlow/PyTorch** - You can use PHP packages like `php-ai/php-ml` to connect your Laravel app with machine learning models. This is great for predictions and analytics.

Laravel + MySQL/MariaDB** - Use Laravel's Eloquent ORM to manage your AI model's data efficiently. It's seamless and fits well with AI operations that need database interactions.
