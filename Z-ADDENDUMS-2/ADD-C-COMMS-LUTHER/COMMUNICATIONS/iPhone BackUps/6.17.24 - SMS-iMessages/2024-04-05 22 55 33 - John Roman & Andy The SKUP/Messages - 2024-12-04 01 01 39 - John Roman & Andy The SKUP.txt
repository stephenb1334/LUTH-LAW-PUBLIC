Excellent. Sounds good

Will get you stuff as soon as possible

On side note, Steve had someone break into their house last night and caught the person in the act. We will do our best to have things to you by the end of the week.

This happened at 2am and he‚Äôs been dealing with police reports, insurance, etc.

He ended up having to beat the guy down while his wife called the police.

Craziness

Thank you, John, for steering the ship in my absence and resetting timelines. Thank you, Andy, for the excitement to meet and learn more. 

I'm back in the saddle after a hectic couple of days there, but I have my focus back and the fam is a-okay. I‚Äôll open a future meeting with the story behind it. Not one for faint of heart but a good ending for sure 

I am looking forward to getting you the one-pager and landing page shortly. Then we can go from there and set a day/time.

Andy, I am writing to confirm 2pm today.

I am meeting with my design/branding arm this afternoon to tweak our material pre-launch. 

I committed to you sending our landing page and a 1-pager, but I‚Äôd prefer to share after today‚Äôs meeting if that will suffice. 

Coming in, I‚Äôd love to hear what you are working towards with the 18 APIs you mentioned, where you see AI taking your company, obstacles, etc., and also, having run incubators, startup accelerators, and venture fund previously very curious to learn about your incubator model and approach. 

Also, it would be appropriate for me to verbalize the mission and vision for AI-minded and the academy we are launching to add context lacking from material sent ahead of time. 

As I mentioned in person, this is the fun stage. You‚Äôll hear more later on that and what that affords us to do before we declare our initial positioning.
