Hope you had a great holiday and looking forward to the new year. Everything is going well! I don't think we need anything! As for the mail, we kept everything that came through and there was stuff for both you and Melissa. 

Ethan is at the apartment while I'm visiting my family in NJ. He's going to be heading to NJ sometime tomorrow. So, if you'd like to stop by the apartment today to pick up mail that would be great! You could text Ethan at +19088926170 for logistics. I also added him to this message. ",,
Ethan Witherup & Katie 246 Old City Tenant,2023-12-28 12:10:48,,,,SMS,Outgoing,,,Sent,,,"Thanks, Katie!

Ethan, would it be possible to put the mail in a bag or box in the lobby maybe (or even better ...placed out front of you 4D hallway door maybe behind the pillar in the hallway)? Tomorrow morning might be best but we might have time to swing by today around 4pm. If we can't at 4pm today then I would def swing by tomorrow mid to late morning

I have no need to come in especially if no one is there and there is no requested reason to enter. 

This way, our timing doesn't have to match up and timing won't be an issue as you won't have to be there for me to get the bag of mail if it's left behind the pillar on the 4th floor where I can quickly grab it",,

I'll put all the mail in a bag behind the pillar just outside the 4D hallway door. I'll go do that right now so feel free to come by when it is most convenient for you.,,

I just want to update you on some minor issues we've run into. Our oven has stopped working (just the oven not the stovetop). When we turn it on, it gives us an error code and it is just very finicky with preheating. It completely stopped working a couple of days ago. Ethan can reply with a bit more info cause he did some research on it. Also, we just found a cockroach! Not sure if that was an issue you ran into often here but I was wondering if you had any advice and if I should get pest control to come. Thank you!!

Also we've noticed a lot of your mail has arrived here. If you'd like we can package it all up and mail it to you all together. ",,

I looked into it and there was an F1 error we noticed on the display. That indicates that the oven's temperature was read over the allowed maximum. This can happen if the circuit board is fried or the temperature probe is malfunctioning. Sounds like an easy fix with the right part. I might try to clean the temperature probe first and see if that works.,,

I had a delivery from Best Buy accidentally go to your address. I failed to update my account address when ordering something expensive on Best Buy's app the other day. 

In trying to track it down, I realized the mistake I made. It was delivered today at 2:30pm. It is a very small package and very light weight. It is likely just outside the building front door or someone brought it in.

Could you please check if it arrived in my name?",,

As for the oven. We are deciding on a few things and could use your input. 

Long story short, if you decide to not renew your lease with us, no problem, but we'd be happy either way. The decision just steers our decision making. Im hoping to get a sense of your intent sooner than i normally would however - for the sake of helping us plan ahead. 

If you decide to not renew, we are considering taking the opportunity to give the condo a makeover and redo the kitchen, bathrooms, etc. As you know, the condo is awesome but needs modernizing. 

That said, you need a new oven, the condo needs a new oven. 

If you are wanting to renew the lease, we will buy a decent oven very shortly. But there is no pressure to know your decision now. Check the lease i think you have a 60 day notice period to alert us by. 

However, we wouldnt want to buy a decent oven today, then redo the kitchen in the Fall, only to learn we bought an oven we have to design around, wrong size, color, etc.

So, if you are not renewing, we would likely install a temporary, standalone oven suitable to get you through until end of lease. Then buy the oven that fits the kitchen design. 

Think it through and feel free to share your thoughts, express questions, i just am glad youre open to hearing our side of this decision. Thanks again",,

We are in fact considering renewing the lease in the fall. We're fairly sure that we don't want to move again and we're happy where we are and love the area. 

If you feel comfortable getting a new oven and not a temporary one that would be great with us. As of now, we have no plans to move but we will let you know if that changes at that 60 day mark.",,

We recently saw a few roaches in our bedroom and bathroom area and we think we want to get a treatment done again. I'm not sure if the problem has gotten worse in the building since we've moved here but we've seen cockroaches around the building as well especially on the first floor so it seems like it's gotten worse throughout the whole building. Thank you so much for your understanding!",,
