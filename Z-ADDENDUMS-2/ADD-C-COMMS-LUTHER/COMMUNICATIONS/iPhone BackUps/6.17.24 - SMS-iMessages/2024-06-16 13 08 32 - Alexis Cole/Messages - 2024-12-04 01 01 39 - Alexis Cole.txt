Would like to meet them both. Paul says I should charge some rent, so I‚Äôll make some (super reasonable) proposal and you guys can see the place and we can all decide what‚Äôs best. But it would definitely solve some problems for us to have the house occupied.

Hi there! Just looked at a few places today and a couple more tomorrow and Wednesday I think as well. Trying to cram it all in this week. 

Would you be open to sharing an idea of cost for these scenarios‚Ä¶

1) Fixed, monthly cost of a true 12-month rental agreement 

2) Cost for the single month of November (per the original plan of Lucy, Melissa, and myself living in your home for 30 days as an interim bridge for us between homes)

3) Same as #2 above, but for 2 months (November and December), not just November

We are leaning into exploring other neighborhoods and like a couple options we‚Äôve seen. Nothing we‚Äôve seen that we love LOVE, so a couple more days of showing are in the books. I‚Äôm about to call your realtor as well. 

The request for pricing is to help us understand all options with more clarity. It also assumes you two felt good about it which we would totally understand if you‚Äôd like to go another direction or opt for the single Tennant. We would have zero hard feelings and we may be the ones to back out which is also probable just to be transparent. Depends on what we see this week

$1200/month for Nov and/or Nov + Dec 
12 month lease would be from Nov-Nov but rent would stay at $1200 until the bathroom is finished which we‚Äôre projecting at January 1. But if it‚Äôs later we‚Äôll keep it at $1200 til then. But if it‚Äôs sooner, we‚Äôll keep it at $1200 til Jan. 
Price after the bathroom is finished is $2400 for the remainder of the year. 

Also- nice perks
1. Early move in- if you wanted to start getting things over here and set up in advance of Nov 1 that‚Äôs fine.

2. You can use whatever furniture and dishes etc we have here until you replace them with your own, or until we need a particular thing, probably not til at least January. 

3. All windows have new blinds and the house will be freshly painted and really clean. 

We‚Äôd want to do a $2400 deposit   Even if it‚Äôs just for Nov, since Paul and the hardwood floor specialist made me paranoid about dog damage. 

And if something here doesn‚Äôt quite work for you, we‚Äôre open to making it work.  

If you decide to go ahead Paul (who has a real estate license) will draw up something legal for the protection and comfort of all.

Hi! Just letting you know we would need likely a week more to know exact plans for beyond  November 30th‚Ä¶but I would say as of today if the offer is there we are 90 percent likely to need your home to stay in for the month of November.

We would know before going into November (hopefully no later than next week) if we would opt for a 12 month lease with you two. 

I think Melissa is leaning towards water front-ish and hey I get it when in rome, but options are pricier than I realized. But that has always been our goal together so if we find the right spot, we may take it.

We keep coming back to how affordable and beautiful your home is so we are weighing it all

2023-10-17 19:01:53 from Alexis Cole (+16462397464) - Read

Cool, the way I laid out the offer, there‚Äôs really no need to commit to 12 months, there‚Äôs no $ break, and we wouldn‚Äôt list the house until the bathroom is complete anyway. Also we can keep the utilities in our name and just have you reimburse for them at the end of each month til a long term lease took effect.

Thank you for the invite and happy birthday from both of us.

We have one set of family leaving Sunday morning via TPA while 2 sisters and their two husbands arrive at TPA. Hotel Steve is officially open for business. 

If the timing works, I might be a free ride back to Gulfport Sunday if you want to let me know eta but otherwise we have to pass. 

Please come over for dinner after this herd of Yankees gets their sunshine fix tho

Hey! Are you free this upcoming week for a drink meetup in Gulfport? 

I'm working through some concepts ahead of launching my company. 

I have been holding, and continue having, meeting with niche entrepreneurs as part of my pre-launch strategy. 

It would be a discussion around your experience in your work, broadly speaking.  Informal for me, and informal for you, but each of these meetings I aim to give more value than I get. By the end, I can garner enough about your business, goals, roadblocks, etc to apply what I know to returning the favor of the discussion - outside of my business, a sweet spot for me was always consulting and guiding so many companies. Whether I can offer ideas, strategy, introductions to key people, etc it always varies. Building tech companies is like my Jazz voice haha

I'm pretty flexible and you both are obviously welcome to join just me and maybe Melissa can join when we are done just to keep on track 

----------------------------------------------------

Impressive action! Way to stand up for yourself. Did he realize someone was home? Was it while you were sleeping?

How are you feeling? Did you ever find out more about the perpetrator? 

Paul and I are going to Sunrise service on Gulfport beach for Easter Sunday. Wanna join us? It‚Äôs at 7am. We invited our home exchange friend Evy too.

Hi! We aren't 100 percent but definitely close. 

Just wish the guy who broke in didn't live around the corner but maybe that's safer we don't know. 

All in all I think good. We had more damage to the house than we realized from the shake up so just tending to that this weekend and getting in beach time today. 

Melissa works a full shift on Sunday and I will respectfully pass on the sunrise service but would meet afterwards. Thank you for the invite :)

Hiya! Do you know Plug PV? My brother is thinking of working for them. 

----------------------------------------------------
Alexis Cole
2024-06-16 11:23:45 to Alexis Cole - Read

Hi! I did some solid research on them. 

Headquartered in NY but seem to be spread across the east coast so thats good in terms of sustainability on the job security front. 

I loved their website and videos but im never swayed by that as its too easy to create a false veneer, but the testimonials sounded genuine. 

Their better business bureau (BBB) rating is 4.15/5 with negative mentions of pushy sales people but cant judge the whole on the sum of a few bad apples. I always look at a site called Glassdoor which is a review platform from the employee's perspective. They have a 4.5/5 with 86% saying they recommend working there. If its a bad company to work for, people dont hold back on glassdoor as its anonomous and you typicallg get the truth. Hard for companies to create false reviews 

I like their contributions to non profits and local partnership approach. 

All in all, im not seeing any show stoppers. One of the better online presences for solar ive seen. As a whole however, its the solar industry. In florida solar is seen in a very seedy light. In the north east its much more friendly and received differently but winter months are a killer for new business so if your brothers income is tied to producing revenue then he should consider that. What role is he going for exactly?
