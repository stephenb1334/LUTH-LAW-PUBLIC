Ya for this search tool it‚Äôs actually best to put as few filters in as possible, and then you would just have to go through the listings and check out each property to either rule out or rule in.

I‚Äôll be on a flight next 3 hours just in case you need a quick answer.   We could do right before but are busy in the morning so maybe 1:30pm or 2pm or after the 3pm Howelville could work.

Hey - sorry if that was longer than you bargained for- Did Melissa like it ? Did you like it as much the 2nd time in? 
In general I feel like the owner is pretty straight forward - (like I said he obviously wants to protect his investment) I think the value is there (you saw the Grange Rd. rental and that owner got many offers for the list price of $2900  so for $3000 I feel like you‚Äôd be getting more space, privacy and more property in the Howelville  home. That on top of the lack of inventory for rentals -(that accept pets) makes it appealing. It‚Äôs all personal preference. It doesn‚Äôt have the wear and tear that a home might have if it was consistently rented over the years. I think they have maintained it well- the systems looked clean / up to date - Do you have any thoughts surrounding  a purchase ? Depending on how you feel about the property, and location overall , it might be worth talking to your mortgage person to look at the numbers -as far as I can tell from public records they refinanced in 2018 and have a mortgage or $353,683 just fyi

He basically handed us all the info - that he got offers for $500k and $525k which had contingencies (assuming mortgage and inspection) but that he would have considered $570k- I know your max is $550k but if you had interest I court talk to the listing agent.

Hi Steve - what are your thoughts on everything, as of thismorning?

We talked a lot about it. We just have a gut feeling renting from Jason will feel like are walking on egg shells by living there. Like it won‚Äôt feel like our home. Hard to phrase into a text but as much as we like it, we both just have a gut feeling it‚Äôs not right for us so we are going to pass
