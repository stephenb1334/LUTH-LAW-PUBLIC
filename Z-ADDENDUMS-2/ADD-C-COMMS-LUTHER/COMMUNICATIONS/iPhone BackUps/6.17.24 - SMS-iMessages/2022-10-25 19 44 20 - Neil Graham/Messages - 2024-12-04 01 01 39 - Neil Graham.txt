Hi Neil, couple things to discuss when you have a chance. Main thing is: ohio DPS (BMV) we have a day and time that works for demo with CIO and want to confirm with you. Also want to discuss NJ turnpike (great call with a Tom) and can discuss Molly (UiPath) call I had earlier today.

Hi Neil! Steve Boerner here. I‚Äôm reaching out to see if you‚Äôd be open to me picking your brain about something non PayIt related‚Ä¶more related to career advice and the path you took. Easier to explain over the phone.

Great call with Kirby. Gave great advice for a pre series A CRO. He said to focus on velocity, RevOps doesn‚Äôt have to be perfect, hire someone to help build that post series A, and vary strategy to align with the company stage through exit, velocity first, momentum second
