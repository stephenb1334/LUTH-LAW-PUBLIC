 Nate, my friend, how are you. Enjoying the football match I presume. Ah, sport. 

Digress I shall. Serious matters bring news from the bay. 

Summer, like all, will subside come near Autumn sparking the punctual podcasts, rioting reels, and cringeworthy shorts to boot, I, I will be among the commoners, no longer armed iPad and cheat sheet in tow. Yes, me, scrolling from the stands, though in this daydream, magical! fantastical! stands are these stands, too. Miles high the are. Fit for a king, really, but views for the gods. You know the type 

off to new pastures with fond memories of my fantasy career I am yes. 

Im proud of my time in the league. A 13 year career veteran and a pension due in time no doubt. With you at the helm, such seas set part. 

Proud of my time, truly, with moment of pride I'll reflect on in time. To never lose Yahoo's Bronze trophy user designation. Now...that honor, that distinction, well, makes it all worth it. 

Career highlight superficialities aside, I'm most proud of you. You took the reins. No complaints. Just got to work. You have a bright future ahead. I wish you the best 

With that said, it brings me equal sadness and pride to formally submit my resignation. 

I'm not big on the whole limelight thing - never really been one to brag about
