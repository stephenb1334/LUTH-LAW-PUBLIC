Good morning Steve. Unfortunately I am traveling on Friday to San Antonio fly back on Sunday night. Please let me know which ones you would like to see on Friday and I will ask Daniela to set up showings. Did you have time to complete the application so I can have you approved today. Also I have a few new Rental homes that just came up that I will be sending to you to review.

I havenâ€™t finalized the application. I canâ€™t find my social security card sadly. Your service has called me several times to complete it and Iâ€™ve paid the $74.

We can review the properties this evening but they are all in different spots like screen shots here and the site you provided I was unsure which spots are eligible and which arenâ€™t . Is there one clean list of eligible properties? Weâ€™re interested in both Oct 1st and Nov 1st start dates
