Hi Frank, my name is Steve Berner. Juliana Martell is my neighbor and realtor here in Old City. 

I asked Juliana for a referral to a quality handyman and she gave me your cell number. 

We are moving end of month and have tenants moving in October 1st. 

I have a short list of repairs I can share if youâ€™re interested

We are at 246 N 3rd St, Philadelphia

Hi Steve, thanks for reaching out!  This is Meg the office manger.  Please send the list and Iâ€™ll see if we can squeeze it into the schedule.  

Full transparency we are booked until mid October but depending on the repairs may be able to squeeze it in.
