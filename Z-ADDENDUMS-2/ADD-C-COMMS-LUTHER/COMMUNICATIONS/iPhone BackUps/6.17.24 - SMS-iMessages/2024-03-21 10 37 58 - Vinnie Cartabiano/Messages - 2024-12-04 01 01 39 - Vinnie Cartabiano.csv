The reason for the downturn I think is solely due to market manipulation by whales and exchanges. Notice how the FUD has died down since the price crashed. If we’re in a Wyckoff accumulation phase then we’ll see a lot of fakeout pumps and dumps while whales accumulate for the next leg up.",,

Curious if you see the Wyckoff trend continuing down. Figured buying a little at 32k wasn’t too but a risk.

You thinking of getting more into BTC now? I remember you saying in summer you would shift over. Granted, we didn’t have the gains we projected for ETH and link this summer but just seeing where your head is at given the current conditions ",,

I think we’re in an accumulation phase still where big players are trying to push the market down as much as possible to get retail to capitulate. I’m still adding to my stack. 

Smartcon 1 (Chainlink’s big annual conference) is in one month as well so hopefully we’ll start seeing some positive price action leading up to that. The people who have made millions in crypto have had to hold through drops as bad or worse than what we’ve seen the past few months. That’s just part of the game.",,
