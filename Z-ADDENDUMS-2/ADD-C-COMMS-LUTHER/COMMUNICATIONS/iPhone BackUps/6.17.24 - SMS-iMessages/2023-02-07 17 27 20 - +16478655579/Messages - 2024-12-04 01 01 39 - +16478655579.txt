Francois, I just gave you a call but your voicemail is full just an FYI.

This is Steve from SureBright. I opted to call you vs email as we have the attention of the right insurance carrier to forward your vision for a warranty package. 

Our CEO, Manish Chauhan, and myself are pitching the the insurance carrier on behalf of HPS tomorrow at 3:30pm EST.

Manish and I need some higher level detail in anticipation of questions they will ask. We want to ensure we are representing your vision correctly and would like to request 20 minutes of your time tomorrow between 8am - 2pm est. 

I know you're away and want to respect that, but is a call tomorrow with us at all possible?
