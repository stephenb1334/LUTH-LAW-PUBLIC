Hi jack, Rich Gagnon CIO will be a part of the decision. CTO Jim Wallace is not part of the decision but endorsed us and got us listed to receive the RFP. Jim told me they are committee buyers and he‚Äôs not on that unfortunately but did give his recommendation after several interactions with PayIt earlier in the year
