I am a freshman journalism major at Kent State University. For my final in one of my journalism courses we have to write a featured article about an interesting person, business, or event. After talking with one of my professors, Mr. Oleg Lougheed was so gracious to let me interview him. We are required to have two additional sources in our article. Mr. Lougheed forwarded me your contact information. If you are able to, I would greatly appreciate it if I could set up a phone interview with you to be one of my sources?
Thank you 
Abigail L Kinney",,
