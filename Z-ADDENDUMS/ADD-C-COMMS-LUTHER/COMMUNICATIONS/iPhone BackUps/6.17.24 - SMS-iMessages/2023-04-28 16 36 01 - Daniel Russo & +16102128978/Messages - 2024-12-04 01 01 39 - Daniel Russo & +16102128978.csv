This is Stephen Boerner, a client of Ed's.

On March 7th, 2023: worked with Ed to create an S-Corp called North New Associates Co. 

The Pa. Gov website entity search doesn't show it. The site stated 'As of 4/28/2023, we have processed all business filings received in our office through 4/12/2023. I believe Ed said we expedited with the State to avoid the long wait?

Feels like something is off. I'm wondering what you see on each of your ends and how we get work towards finalizing this. Then get set up with PNC for business banking 

Thank you, Steve",,
