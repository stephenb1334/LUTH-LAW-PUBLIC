Unless you want to come by any point before the move we are happy to do that. It would be good to meet maybe so you know who we are in person and all that...plus you can take a look at what we have but zero pressure. We'd give away most of it if you want it. we are moving to Florida so it's stuff we don't want to haul down there 

also think it would help you if we could show you a couple things like just little nuances to living there, give you door codes, garage fabs, etc ",,

I know in a previous email, Juliana said that our move in date would ideally be a few days before October 1st.

We have turned on WiFi but we have a LTE Verizon home system. We might want to set up a router. Is there a router here already? If not where was it before?,,
Katie 246 Old City Tenant,2023-10-04 21:52:16,,,,SMS,Outgoing,,,Sent,,,A router is not there. There are two white coax cables coming from the walls. One is below the desk and the other is coming out of the living room wall to the right of the tv stand. Those white cables screw into the backs of routers. We had our primary router in the living room and got good internet through the whole house. I also used a Wi-Fi router  in the office under the desk for a second network I used for work but that was for my needs but either way both white cables allow for two options to place a router I recommend the living room,,

Katie 246 Old City Tenant,2023-12-28 11:06:09,,,,SMS,Outgoing,,,Sent,,,"Hi Katie! Hope all is well. We are currently visiting family in Philadelphia. I'm writing for two reasons. 

Firstly, I wanted to check in and see how everything is going and if you need anything? If something needs fixing or may in-person evaluation, then I should be able to stop by this week. If everything is a-okay then great!

Secondly, I'm wondering if you can assist me in something related to our mail. Turns out I never activated mail forwarding and only Melissa activated hers. I'm guessing you have been receiving lots of mail addressed to me? If so, I'm wondering if you happened to keep any of it. And if so, then could I stop by to pick it up?

Thank you, Katie as always! Happy holidays and happy new year!",,
