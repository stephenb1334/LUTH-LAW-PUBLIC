Rick, I'd like to set up a time Tuesday for the two of us.  Perhaps every Tuesday moving forward. We can discuss what the best recurring cadence is for you and I when we speak. I'd like to fast track the priorities we discussed. 

What time works for you on Tuesday 8/8?

I will get it booked on our calendars for Tuesday and will call your cell then

Sorry guys, but I have to be cautious with my time, I am compensated as an Advisor, not full time employee. I can do Sales Meeting Monday and allocate some time after the Sales meeting for further discussion. 
I am already spending more time than originally planned reviewing engineering, creating training materials, taking calls from Sales reps and filing permits.

This is a scam. Dug into it a bit. It's clickbate to funnel someone into a $99 deposit via Stripe. Even tried calling and texting their number which was flagged for real estate robo calls trying to find wholesale flip opportunities. I was able to listen to recordings of the flagged calls. It's an AI bot they have named "June" that sounds somewhat real. Their LinkedIn page has an AI video of "her" pitching how her/AI can handhold Solar every step of the way

- 9am Thursday I am pitching Rick the "Why Solar/Why Solar First" story (slides 1-3 of our sales deck)via Google Meet. Derek/Rick invited. See calendar. 

- Taking Rick's feedback to finalize "why solar/solar first" new sales deck

- giving new deck to reps this week (assuming leadership alignment on our most important story in the market)

- The revised sales deck is same order or topics as Ricks, so they will add in their variable components (PV Watts/OpenSolar, optionality, pricing)

- This Friday is on-site site survey training. Location is not related to Monday's presentation 

- Next Monday in office is their training capstone presentation of the sales deck.

- Monday marks conclusion of training. Reps then required to focus solely on getting in-field top of funnel reps - focused on strategic partner handshakes, networking, etc. and I will be managing those expectations heavily. 

- contingency plan: if we don't have agreement by Thursday the Why Solar/Solar First story is SOLID then they still present Monday, but present Rick's sales deck

Rick,

Rep calls are coming your way today.

I have them taking this very seriously. 

Today, I'm looking for consistency in:

1) their ability to qualify you as a lead, present Solar First professionalism, and establish themselves as a credible "non-pirate" quickly 

2) their ability to book a next-steps meeting with you for Monday 9am 

3) and to be very direct in how they get your commitment to meet Monday - i.e. that you are a serious buyer who respects a serious seller and designer of solar systems. This commitment is required to validate the motion of designing a system, traveling to a prospect, and presenting any system/pricing.
