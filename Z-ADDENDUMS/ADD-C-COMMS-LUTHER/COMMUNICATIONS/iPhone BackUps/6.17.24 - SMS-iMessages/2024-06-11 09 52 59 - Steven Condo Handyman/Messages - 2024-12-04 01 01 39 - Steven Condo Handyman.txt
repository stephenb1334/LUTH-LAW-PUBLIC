Hi Steven, my name is Steve I'm the owner of 4D / 4C. We are the ones with the plumbing issue. 

Our plumber is scheduled to arrive between 7-9am tomorrow morning. I was advised that having you there to help answer questions would be a good idea considering I'm still learning how my condo functions.

Are you able to stop by tomorrow morning by chance?
