we can receive texts on that number on the mailer, but we can not currently reply to texts due to the regulatory change and we have a high priority ticket into AirCall to resolve and get registered under new terms. Calls are a non issue both ways. That is great news. Even with this happening, we will not miss a call or text from the mailer. If they text our Aircall number I will see it, then call them, or can text them through a non-airball number should I need to, but will stick to calling/emailing and texting off aircall until its fully resolved
