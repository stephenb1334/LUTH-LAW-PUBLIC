I Just got a call back and agreed to take next steps with the attorney I was hoping to get. oddly enough since I texted you earlier not sure if someone would pursue with me I now have someone with an optimistic (albeit early for sure), perspective on the details . Still some unknowns she's going to gather details around. I'll let you know how it all goes ",,

Matt Miller,2024-02-29 15:35:01,2024-02-29 15:35:08,,,iMessage,Outgoing,,,Delivered,,,"Hey bud, just wanted to share a quick update. Went with Scott Law Team - Debbie Baker, after lots of looking around. Was like $7500 retainer. $475 an hour. Is what it is. 

She sent the legal Representation letter last week letting them know not to contact me and that my lawyer is reviewing separation terms. 

The Week of March 11th the demand letter goes out with a window of dates to respond by. 

My due diligence report was 116 pages so hopefully it's organized in a way that helps Debbie, my lawyer, finalize what goes in the demand letter. Florida is a brutal state for my circumstances. But we stood up and are fighting. 

Just wanted to keep you in the loop. I'd be lost still without your help initially, so thank you again.",,
