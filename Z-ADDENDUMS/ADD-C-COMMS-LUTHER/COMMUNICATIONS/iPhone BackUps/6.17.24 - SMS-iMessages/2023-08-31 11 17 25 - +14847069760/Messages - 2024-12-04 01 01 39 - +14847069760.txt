Hi, Steve. Kathie here trying to wrap up some loose ends. Did Jon share this about transferring the ThisWeekinPublicHealth.com domain: https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/876/83/how-to-transfer-a-domain-from-godaddy/ ? Also, can you tell me what font the Layr logo is in? TIA

Transfer info sent to Jon. The font I believe is Sans Sarif. In Canva I created multiple logos for Layr and you should be able to go into one of the designs and confirm. It's also the same font used throughout the website

Thank you. I looked for the Layr logo in there before, but it doesn't seem to be shared with me or the team ðŸ¤”

I just appointed you both as admins, then found where to appoint you as owner

Thank you. That was a good idea.  I think you need to go into the individual design and share it, though, because I still can't see it
