What sizing of solar are you using/ planning to use? The self consumption mode works really well with a solar system; it allows the battery to store excess solar generation before crediting them to the grid.

The backup mode is primarily used for keeping the batteries full in prepare of grid outages. This way it maximizes the backup hours.",,

And I read that consumption only batteries are better for states with time of use charges. Is that true? Florida does not have time of use (yet) so maybe this route is more proactive to that happening?

We have net-metering in Florida as well. I’m realizing the poor return on net metering so this might give me more value to store vs return excess to the grid. 

Lots here and we can discuss Wednesday but also happy to text for now until then",,
