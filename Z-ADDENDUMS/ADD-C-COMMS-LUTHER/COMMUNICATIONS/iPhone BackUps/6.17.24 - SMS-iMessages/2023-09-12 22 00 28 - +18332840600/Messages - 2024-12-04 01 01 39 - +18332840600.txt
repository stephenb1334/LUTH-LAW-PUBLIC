Hi! It's Ivy! Check-out lines at the hotel can be long. Here's some tips to avoid them.

If you just want to check-out, here's a link to do it from your mobile device. Just click and your check-out is underway! Fast and easy! The check-out link works on your day of check-out beginning at 4am up until 12pm. :)

You may also view your bill and check-out using the menu option on your TV. If you parked your car in the hotel parking lot, please make sure to bring your room keys with you so you can exit the parking structure when departing.

If you are using the safe in your room, don't forget to remove your personal items and leave it unlocked when departing tomorrow.
