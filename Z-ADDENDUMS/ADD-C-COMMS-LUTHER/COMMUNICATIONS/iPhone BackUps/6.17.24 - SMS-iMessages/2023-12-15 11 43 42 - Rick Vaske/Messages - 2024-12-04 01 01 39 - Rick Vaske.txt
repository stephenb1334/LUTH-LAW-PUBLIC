I'd like to address the shortcomings of my pitch and present how I plan to respond. In addition, to get your advice. That was a terrible representation of how to sell solar and how I plan to be the best version of what you're teaching.

We can discuss later. I'd rather you first go back and redo the assignment. 
1. The Qualifying questions and facts about the house were no where in your presentation
2. You need to go to the Sales Training site and utilize the appropriate training materials, you used none of them
3. You need to present Products, that is what people are buying, you had none in yours
4. Don't stray and make up your own presentation facts and materials. 
Spend some time learning from the existing tools and redo the assignment.

Hi Rick, seeking your insights 

I'm running some AI analysis across the 20 most recent reviews of our 5 biggest competitors. 

The outcome allow us to see key themes which I cross reference with google ads keyword trends. It's a smarter way to keyword bid, target pains, etc.. Can share more later. Very insightful. 

I'm running this analysis on both national and local competitors. Here is this short list. Can you please verify or offer tweaks:

National: 
- Sunrun
- Tesla 
- Generac 
- Semper Solaris 

Local:
- Suncoast Power Solutions 
- Advance Solar & Energy
- Florida Solar, LLC
- Green House Solar & Air

Local list is based on volume of reviews 

Any company I'm missing?

Rick,

I have wins to share in the form of having added two new deals to the pipeline last week. 

Both stem from in-person/in-home meetings held last Thursday the 19th and Saturday morning the 21st. 

Both are being presented by me in-person tomorrow. Full detail is in our CRM. 

The first of two leads was generated via our lead gen funnel mailer. It is non-battery, 20kw system, 50 panels (with optionality). I met with this this most recent Saturday morning. 

The second was generated via Angi‚Äôs List. Includes Panasonic battery, small 10 kw system (with optionality)

Good in person proposal deliveries yesterday. 

The Brad Knowles, Cape Coral, 46 panel deal is on the 1 yard line..husband and wife taking the weekend to decide but I'm very optimistic. Built a strong relationship there quickly.

The smaller Panasonic battery deal won't be an October close. He is taking 3 weeks to gather proposals and we are first in which isn't ideal. He committed to not sharing our proposal and sharing others with me. Best Solar is a company he's talking to and they are promoting a "Consumption Only" battery which is new to me but I'm researching it now

I felt the same. I did the role play with her and had to cut it short. 

Then spent 40 minutes giving her my best 101 overview stepping entirely too far backwards to basic human to human interaction BS. It's just not there 

thought I saw a possible path before this role play but not after, and not with what we have in front of us. 

No more reps for now. Agree. And when we do scale hiring, we need to screen reps in the interview process using your rubric and style, not mine, not Nevans. 

I'm a fan of interviewees being given detailed mock scenarios with the pressure to pitch for the job....seeing the prep & hearing the pitch ...pre-hire...for free, not 3 weeks into their W2 burn.

Naples deal was quoted by competitors at 16 panels (400W), with enphase microinverters , and all metal roof standoffs with installation for $17,500.

It was news to him about the 300W enphase restriction. 16 400W panels only results in 77% offset based on annual consumption and the rep told him 97%.

He now knows his quotes misrepresent actual kW. Which is 4.8, not 6.4.

he wants options with enphase microinverters ...zero interest in battery for now but open to being designed for add on later 

- 400W panels would be 21 panels

- 385W would also be 21 panels with microinverters 

His preferred price range is $17-$19k

No worries man, let that Naples just go and see what he decides... People that shop multiple quotes like that obviously don't really know what they are buying, you can educate them, put your proposal in the running and then walk away. We have a good price and you did your best to inform.

FYI... His Garage Door is actually labeled "Shutters" ... it's has a "Stop Trip" on it that was kicked off probably when you took the face plate off... and then when he hit tue button to close his garage, it tripped the breaker. I did not set the stop trip back, because these are actually a terrible thing on old service panels that can lead to fires. But... If that breaker trips again before we go back... Just remind him... even though I explained it, that it's the SHUTTERS Breaker... Not the Garage Breaker... FYI.. He is convinced that YOU rewired it this way because it "wasn't that way before" ü§£ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Rick - I have a deliverable for Derek due at 7:30pm so I'm heads down on that. 

If you have any time after 8pm tonight, I will take it. Main priority is Hanke addendum, but I have a list of things for us to discuss 

I'll send you the addendum draft in our legal template later tonight as I'm going to Wilfried Hankes at 11am tomorrow so I need to get it right. 

The basic terms I drafted in the above screen shot. 

If you could give me your blessing or edits on the final addendum details, that is all I really need before tomorrow

0-3 on finding an electrician that wants to touch that panel swap out and those old wires. Just struck out with the 3rd one yesterday. We are going to be sending a Legal cancellation of the contract with full refund plus interest. This was not a good Solar fit from the beginning and I don't want my license or insurance attached to it
