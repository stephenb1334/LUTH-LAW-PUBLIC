Hi Matt, my name is Steve Boerner, and I’m an RGA member in Mark’s Pinellas chapter so just recently as I am moving further south.

Mark gave me your phone number when we sat down to talk about some initiatives. I was working on and how I might be able to benefit from some of the resources RGA affords. 

To keep the text message short (too late!) Mark recommended that I text you first as it was something that you would be the best person to speak with. That’s all a bit vague but hopefully we can schedule some time in person or over the phone and I will run you through it at your convenience .
