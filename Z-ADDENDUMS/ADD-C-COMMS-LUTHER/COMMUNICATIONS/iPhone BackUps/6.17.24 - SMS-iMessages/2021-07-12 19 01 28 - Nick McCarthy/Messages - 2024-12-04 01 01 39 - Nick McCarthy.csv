Do you know if he‚Äôs looking to video conference or just chat by phone? He didn‚Äôt specify and I am traveling home from DC, I‚Äôd pull over and find a Starbucks if he‚Äôd like to do more than a phone call!

Secondly, and last minute advice!",,

I spoke to her last week for the first time and just this afternoon for a second time, both great conversations. My next step I believe was she was going to have me sync with Clayton Berry and then potentially have a discovery call where they‚Äôd have me answer some questions around how I would approach a specific contact/what questions or things I would look to leverage that were specific to their job role/environment",,

If they are sending you to Clayton that means they like you and want you to learn about the company outside of an interview setting ,,
