LOVE SONG of J ALFRED PRUFROCK:

And indeed there will be time to 
Lift and drop questions on your plate;
Time for you and time for me,
And time yet for a hundred indecisions,
And for a hundred visions and revisions,
Before the taking of a toast and tea.

Good morning:)

I'm still worried about Melissa. Sad and depressed since Friday morning.  Has been in bed majority of each day since. She has been complaining about nausea a lot, not eating more than a few crackers here or there. Lost a few pounds as well. 

can't seem to get her out of it. She doesn't want to talk about the drinking episode which was so rare but there is a history there I just don't know she won't share much on the topic. 

Either way, I'm just struggling to help Melissa and wanted to reach out to see maybe if you could please check in with her today. She has an interview at 4pm today for a nursing job in a recovery center and wants to cancel it. I think she should stick with  the interview today just to get in a motion of sorts. 

Barb and Mike come Wednesday which should help, but maybe you have an idea to help before then? 

She mentioned a prescription she wanted/needed, but didn't want to ask you. I don't know what it was called but it was for nausea

Anyway, thank you thank you. Nice to have someone to ask for help on my end. Love her.

Move phone to her bedside in 20 mins. We are past ‚Äúworrying‚Äù. Each adult needs to learn to reach out, take appropriate steps to protect their autonomy. Whatever played into this caused Big M to have a meltdown.
