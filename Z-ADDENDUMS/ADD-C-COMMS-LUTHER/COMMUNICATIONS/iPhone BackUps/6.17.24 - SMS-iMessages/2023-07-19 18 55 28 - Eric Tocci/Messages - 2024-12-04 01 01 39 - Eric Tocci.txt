Quick question - we’re thinking of getting Donna (Court’s mom) a golf club for her birthday. Of course she doesn’t use her clubs like a normal golfer (aka will use her driver on a short par 3) and she doesn’t really need a new driver or putter. Any recos? I was thinking maybe a 7 wood

So the guy that owns that house haha. Bought the land for 18k in 1975, but the house by 1976, has zero mortgage so likely no urgency to sell (my assumption...at least he doesn’t have any pressure from a mortgage or the like - also no outstanding back taxes, liens, etc).

Rodger and Joan Dattner who currently have mail forwarded to:

1025 Bennett Rd

It was a one round tournament with barstool. Played a practice round with Morris prior but it’s all over now. Flying back to PHL as we speak. We ended up 8th place at -4 and missed the cut by 3 so won’t be going to pinehurst for the finale but all good. Will play again next year no doubt

As it stands right now, the house is in a trust that is split 3 ways between Court mom and her two uncles.

Ah got it. Well, if you sell off your crypto, track your trades and share with accountant in case you take a loss then you can offset your income tax. 

Not sure if Link brought you down into the negative in terms of overall profit or not. If you’ve made a profit and sell, you have to pay capital gains tax either short or long term depending on when you bought it

Hello friend, thanks for checking in. My dad is doing fine and on the long recovery path. Honestly, we’re lucky he’s in the state he is in and not worse. 

He fell through an open hole in the floor on a on-site and fractured all of his ribs on the left hand side of his body (front and back) as well as his clavicle so he fell in the best way possible. There’s still bleeding in his chest cavity but the chest tube should be removed tomorrow or the day after. 

We’re just incredibly fortune he didn’t need surgery to stop the bleeding, broke his back or hit his head harder. He truly dodged a bullet

It’s been a very long few days but the worst is well behind us. He was just moved out of the ICU about an hour ago. 

At the moment we don’t need anything but thanks for reaching out, I appreciate you. 🙏

5 bays, you can bring down food and drink from the clubhouse, weights and work out equipment and they definitely do PXG fittings there too

Hello my friend, I wanted to check in and see if everything’s ok. 

Your text to the group chat kinda came out of left field and felt like something is up. Probably nothing but wanted to check in. 

I’m here if you need anything my friend

Appreciate that. Nothing is up or bad. All great. Reevaluated my phone habits and trying a new system. Phone was more of an outlet for distraction and not serving me well the way I was using it. I will miss the chat. Always loved that chat over the others but it’s freeing to more removed. Maybe forever, likely not. Just a trial
