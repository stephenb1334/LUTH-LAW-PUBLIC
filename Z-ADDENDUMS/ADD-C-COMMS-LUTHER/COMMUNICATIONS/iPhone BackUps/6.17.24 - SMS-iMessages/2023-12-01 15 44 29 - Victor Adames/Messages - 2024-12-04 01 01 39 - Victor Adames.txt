Hi Victor, 

I just left a voicemail. My name is Steve Berner. I‚Äôm calling from Solar First per your request for Rooftop Solar information on Angi‚Äôs List. 

Granted, it‚Äôs a Sunday but don‚Äôt hesitate to call if you‚Äôd like to have an intro conversation. I‚Äôm in the office working all day. Here to help however I can. Or, happy to call you this week. 

Just let me know what you‚Äôd prefer

Hi Victor, 

This is Steve from Solar First. 

I‚Äôd like to propose a phone discussion today. 

Based on the detail you provided me regarding other quotes, there is some important detail to be aware of.

You can take this intel back to the other solar companies to gain confidence in your decision. 

I would feel more confident as well knowing my forthcoming proposal is as accurate and comparable as possible.

I wanted to meet the morning deadline but just sending a proposal without added context isn‚Äôt best for you. My engineer flagged a few things for us. 

An afternoon discussion will result in me providing a firm, confident quote submission that we‚Äôre equally aligned on. I will move my afternoon around based on what time works for you.

Can we take 20 minutes of time to speak late afternoon or when the dust settles on your end?

If you can just give me a price for 7kw / mono panels / emphase micro inverters / all metal roof standoffs and installation this year is all I need to make my decision 

----------------------------------------------------
Victor Adames
2023-11-02 13:31:35 to Victor Adames - Delivered

Enphase Microinverters have a 300W limit. That is often left out of quotes and customers are unaware. So I need to confirm this to provide a quote that is apples to apples comparable. 

Each Enphase microinverter connected to a single panel will only take in 300W. If you have panel sizes in your quote that are over 300W, you are paying for the benefits of a 7.0 kW system, but you‚Äôre not going to actually get a 7.0 kW system. 

If the panels in your quote are 300W, to truly have a 7.0 kW system, you would need 23.33 panels (300W Panel Size x 23.33 panels = 6,999 kW). 
¬†
If the panels are rated at 400W, you would need 17.5 panels for 7.0 kW system  (400 x 17.5 = 7.0 kW) and if your quote has 385W panels, you would need 18.18 panels (385 x 18.18 = 7.0 kW).

How many panels are in your quote and at what wattage per panel?

----------------------------------------------------
Victor Adames
2023-11-02 13:32:27 from Victor Adames (+16315603630) - Read

16 at 400 

----------------------------------------------------
Victor Adames
2023-11-02 13:33:04 to Victor Adames - Delivered

With Enphase micro-inverters, 100W per panel will be wasted. That is a technical mismatch of product design.

----------------------------------------------------
Victor Adames
2023-11-02 13:33:20 to Victor Adames - Delivered

It will show well on paper, but you will not be getting a 7.0 system. 

----------------------------------------------------
Victor Adames
2023-11-02 13:34:00 to Victor Adames - Delivered

That is 6.4kw 

----------------------------------------------------
Victor Adames
2023-11-02 13:34:09 from Victor Adames (+16315603630) - Read

16 panels at 400 watts each

----------------------------------------------------
Victor Adames
2023-11-02 13:36:25 to Victor Adames - Delivered

That is 6,400 = 6.4 kw system ‚Ä¶this was what I wanted to flag. I can help bring more clarity. I‚Äôll send the proposal and would like to explain the purposeful design behind it

----------------------------------------------------
Victor Adames
2023-11-02 13:37:26 from Victor Adames (+16315603630) - Read

They said that would cover 97%

----------------------------------------------------
Victor Adames
2023-11-02 13:40:03 to Victor Adames - Delivered

In reality, because the Enphase Microinverters are restricted to 300W limit per panel, it would be 16 panels x 300 W. 

That equals 4,800 which is a 4.8 kW system. A 4.8kW system will produce roughly 7,867 kWh per year based on the department of energy tool I showed you we use called PV Watts. You used 10,176 kWh over the last 12 months as we pulled up on FPL. 

That is only 77.3%

----------------------------------------------------
Victor Adames
2023-11-02 13:40:57 to Victor Adames - Delivered

The Enphase Microinverter 300W per panel restriction is critical with all this. But it isn‚Äôt communicated

Victor, I enjoyed the back and forth today. Also appreciated you allowing me in on enough information to add value in your evaluation. I hoped it helped.

Yes. 1:30pm on Tuesday, November 7th works great for us. 

Shortly, I will be sending you an email along with a calendar invite with our company address. The email will spell out the proposal details and agenda for Tuesday. 

Derek Piotter, our Solar First CEO, and Kyle Lee, our Customer Service Lead, will be be in attendance to meet and answer questions. I mentioned Kyle I believe. He will be overseeing the permitting oversight. I let him know about your pool delay with permitting. Kyle is very good. 

Email summary coming this weekend I‚Äôm aiming for tomorrow.

Kyle and I are preparing the paperwork for Tuesday for when we sit down. He will also review timeline, how permitting will work, and what to expect so we are all aligned

You are in the running for a customer of the year. Fastest replies we have seen.

I plan to be there on site when we install and then return after inspection to turn on the system.
