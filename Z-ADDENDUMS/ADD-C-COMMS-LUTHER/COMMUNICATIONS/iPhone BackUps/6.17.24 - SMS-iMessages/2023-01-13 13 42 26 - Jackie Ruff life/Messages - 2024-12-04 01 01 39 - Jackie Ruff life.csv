It’s Jackie from ruff life I went to go get your number to say the card wouldn’t work and saw that there is a card on file, the girls looked at the other Lucy not yours. It registered after because I saw their note. I was able to run Melissa’s card. Sorry for the confusion and have a great weekend!!",,

Jackie Ruff life,2023-01-13 08:09:50,,,,SMS,Outgoing,,,Sent,,,Hmm okay please let me know. She just took about 4 solid pees on the walk and 1 poop and I sensed she may have another one but had to drop off. I'll stay close by enough to come back if need be,,
