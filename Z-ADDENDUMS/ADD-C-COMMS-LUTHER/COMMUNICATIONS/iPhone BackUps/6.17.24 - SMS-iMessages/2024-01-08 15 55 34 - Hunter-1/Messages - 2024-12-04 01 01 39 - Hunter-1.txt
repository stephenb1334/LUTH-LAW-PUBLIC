Cool. I'll add him to our list. More have come in. 

I'll continue to share live ones. A church with 51 panels just came in for possible detach/replace but I need to speak to the pastor. Playing phone tag. 

Outside of that, I'd like to grab a focused 30 minute block with you. Can be outside working hours if it helps the scheduling. Like I mentioned...a killer idea to share

I prototyped your use case. I can in fact blend data that points to homeowners who have solar installations with defunct business data with an AI trained to correlate the data within an ArcGIS interface. It's actually epically beautiful to see mapped out. I have Pinellas County only for this prototype, but with lift it could be all of Florida. I could bolster the data points with more detailed information over time and the AI confidence scores would increase over time and with more data and with precedence to train on
