Dad & Mom,2024-02-21 17:39:50,,,,iMessage,Outgoing,,,Sent,,,"I just want to say thank you to you both. Your love and support through this has been incredibly stabilizing for Melissa and me. 

I empathize with the fact that you're directly in the middle as of today it seems. I listened to Sarah's voicemail. I can imagine the difficulty in choosing if, and how, to best respond - that of which is your decision alone and one I respect 

Quick update: Melissa will likely be starting a new nursing role in two weeks. She has her pick from all the great hospitals that want her skills and background.  I'm really proud of how she steps up and pursues something. She's a Boerner, that's for sure. 

Regarding the two weeks Melissa and I set aside (which is unrelated to solar first timing of events and is why my response to Nevan's assistant referenced a 2-week timeframe I would be unavailable), Melissa and I (and Lucy) want to enjoy time together without dealing with what has occupied our attention for many many months. 

That said, even if we weren't promising each other to block out most of the world these next two weeks, given the state of affairs, I would still opt to not come to the table to negotiate at this point in time. I wish it hadn't, but that ship has sailed. 

Please know, we are in a really great spot in life. Adversity is an amazing platform to launch new growth and opportunity. 

And please know this, we love Sarah and Nevan and the kids. I love Sarah and Nevan always. That doesn't change. But our story will be known. Win, lose, or draw, we truly do not have a preference. In this situation, what means the least to us personally is money. 

What means the most to us is principle and Melissa and I is principle and establishing a precedent as a young couple of unified strength and willingness to go to war. In this case, only after all other channels were unsuccessful. 

In the words of Sun Tzu, The Art of War,  'The greatest victory is that which requires no battle.” This is still the goal. 

I hope my hundred hours of due diligence, combined with a good attorney, presents the right environment for us to be taken seriously without a courtroom. 

That said, I align with Sun Tzu when all else fails 'Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when you move, fall like a thunderbolt.” 

I do believe Sarah's voicemail came from a place of love. I love her in return for that. But it did reveal some cards. It shows how little she knows about my story. It reveals cards of uneasiness based on my lack of willingness to talk after that window has already closed. 

Although not under ideal circumstances, we have enjoyed the time off from traditional work schedules and have some fun plans these next two weeks. 

Of course, our immediate friends and family we won't disappear from the next 14 or so days. But we are letting others (not you) know that we are taking this time. I would prefer to continue the updates and convos  with you as we have been. It has been so helpful for us both, but me especially. 

You raised two amazing kids. I can be strong and move this forward with the end in mind. The end, verdict aside, includes a family that is tested and becomes stronger because of it. 

Love you both",,
