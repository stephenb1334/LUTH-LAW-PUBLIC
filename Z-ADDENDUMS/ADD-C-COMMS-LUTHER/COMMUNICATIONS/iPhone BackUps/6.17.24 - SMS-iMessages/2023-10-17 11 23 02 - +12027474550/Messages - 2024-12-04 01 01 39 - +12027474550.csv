Our Fort Myers office just had a similar inbound call recently from a Cape Coral homeowners. It is a 25 panel setup, similar system reporting errors, similar resistance/confusing interactions from their utility company, and is ironically a Solar Edge inverter. 

I’m told we’re able to help that homeowner, but I don’t know what else is being folded in, or the terms, or the scope of work my business partner may or may not have structured into a servicing for a faulty system. We typically can’t do much, so I need to learn more from him tomorrow. 

I’m gathering all the specifics from our internal team once we convene, but I also wanted to get a sense of your availability over the next 1-3 weeks. “3 weeks” only because our internal service tech with a Solar Edge specialty is Fort Myers-based and is requesting it to potentially schedule a service for you.",,

1.) What is the wattage of each panel he has, or total system size in Kilowatts? 

2.) Did he do anything to increase his energy consumption? Like maybe get a Tesla or something? ",,
