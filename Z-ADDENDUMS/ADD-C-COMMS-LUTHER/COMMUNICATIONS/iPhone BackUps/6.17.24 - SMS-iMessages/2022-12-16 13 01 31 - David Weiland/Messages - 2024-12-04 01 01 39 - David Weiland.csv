David Weiland,2022-12-16 10:24:48,2022-12-16 10:24:49,,,iMessage,Outgoing,,,Delivered,,,"No. Not urgent. We have a large prospect.  George Deeb, CEO of Restaurant Furniture Plus. He inquired about our funders and discovered that he knew you. He has Chicago / Notre Dame ties and it was very positive that we discovered this on the call because he is vetting us heavily and concerned with the risk associated with partnering with small startup. Knowing you helped. I didn’t want you to be blindsided by a call or outreach from him. He said he would contact you and had your information. ",,

David Weiland,2022-12-16 11:27:10,2022-12-16 11:27:10,,,iMessage,Outgoing,,,Delivered,,,"Yes please. 

His timeline was “yesterday” so he’s very eager. 

a competitor of ours was about to close him and then fell off the map so he’s frustrated and skeptical. 

It’s a very ripe opportunity in the B2B commercial furniture space (both offline and online warranty).",,

David Weiland,2022-12-16 12:15:15,2022-12-16 12:15:15,,,iMessage,Outgoing,,,Delivered,,,"Yes. The new Amynta deal secures this channel which is unique. Our competitors typically do not pursue B2B wholesale, nor do they do offline warranty upsells. The latter is a month away from completion and a top priority on the roadmap",,
