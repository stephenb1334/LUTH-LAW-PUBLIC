I have to apologize.

I sent the invite for the correct time, but put the incorrect time in the email. I CAN meet today at 9am CST, but have a conflicting meeting I can’t miss at 10am CST.  If there is anyway we can meet at 9am CST I’d appreciate that. If not, let’s plan for the new year. So sorry for this mix up!",,
