Hi Dad, I just tried calling. Can we catch up this evening and I’ll call back then? I just got home from St Pete and working today. As for the wedges, I have not seen them and have not used them or taken them out. I have had clubs taken from me before while they sat outside at a public golf course but that is very rare. I have also left wedges on greens after I putt out and not realized I left them until I got home. Did you try calling the golf club you last played at? Or, maybe they found their way into the wrong golf bag on the cart when you were playing. I’ve done that too

Dad

Hello! Yes we will be in St Pete then and the VRBO is closer to Clearwater and 40 minutes away. Bradenton (where Adam and the wedding is I believe) is South of St Pete so that VRBO might be further than you’d like

What a thoughtful email and we really appreciate it. I just called Melissa as she is in Philly getting ready for the engagement and she felt the same. Thank you. I’m leaving tomorrow to join her. 

Naturally, i see a grill and really miss having one and melissa loves a Boerner man on a grill , so that’s a strong contender but we may think of something else soon.

Also, I have been trying various new web browsers lately looking for something better than Google Chrome and am trying Opera now. It’s off to a good start but I’ll see after a couple weeks how I like it. So far it looks like it could be what I was looking for

You need a new hire and regulator that you can get at HD.
The connection to the grill should be done with Teflon gas connection tape. Wrap it around the threads. Don’t over tighten.
Looks like that is all you need. 
I still don’t see how a fire started at the tank but you are lucky it wasn’t worse. Talk to you this afternoon.

Great seeing you and Melissa the other day.
Mom and I drove straight through to Bethlehem yesterday. Not something we wanted to do but the Annapolis bridge was closed due to high winds so by the time we were near Washington it was too late to do another route to Rock Hall. Long day.
Thanks for all the info on the AI websites. Please send me info as you see fit. I am extremely interested.

Hi Dad, quick update on the legal case. 

We had a consultation with a Florida lawyer that thinks we have good case. 

It cost us $750 to get the initial appraisal and it's another $3,000 for a retainer the lawyer will bill hourly against. 

They kick off the engagement with a "demand letter" on their legal letterhead. This firm came highly recommended and this female lawyer seems sharp and right for this case. 

Last correspondence from Nevan was last Monday, February 5th where he responded to an email from me asking for clarification. I was asking for Solar First's final position on whether they were planning to pay me the owed commissions and expense reimbursement that is still pending. 

Their last stance stated that in order to receive that payment, they required me to sign their Separation Agreement. I needed to know if they were standing firm on that or not. It's unlawful to hold those amounts. 

His response on Feb 5th was that he was in Japan with Sarah and that it sounded reasonable to settle up on that tab but asked if he could get back to me upon his return from Japan. 

Today is Friday, February 16th and I am yet to get any follow up communication. 

Therefore, I am moving forward with the lawyer process and will pay the $3,000 to expedite the demand letter

----------------------------------------------------
Dad
2024-02-16 16:11:42 from Dad (+14848929651) - Read

He is the one making the problem worse- not you… so you have no choice - but once you do, all communication will probably be through your attorney- if he advises you otherwise I would be surprised- that starts to add up.
If you want to talk it over I’m here for you.

I hope you are getting value out of Entrepreneur Magazine- I get it also and even though I am not starting a business, it has some good stuff even for an old entrepreneur like me. Page 12 in the January/February issue is a one page article about using failure. I experienced the feeling of failure and real failure several times in my business career-and  I look back and see how I emerged. I am proud of the way you have emerged from the Solar First situation and I know you will gain more than you lost in the long run… nothing to do with money but something much more valuable.

It is okay. I wasn’t mad. I was exposed for a moment to where my mind was the day i drew that and I was racing that day very hard so I will bring it to show not what I’m working on but my mind during the work. The reaction wasn’t anger. Just getting used to the exposure and facing the past

Hi Dad, this is my self-care plan we discussed in the car. You’ll have to open this screen shot and zoom in on each part to read it. It doesn’t show well on cell phones. 

This is also a mind map that helps me organize and visualize project plans. I saw an email from you about a psychologist and will read soon.

This is really good!
What I have found out is that Clinical psychologists and standard psychologists can give the same level of counseling and therapy. But Clinical psychologists have their MD. That is the main difference so med monitoring has to be done by an MD. Mark should be looking for a psychiatrist mostly so you have the med monitoring. I think Mark is right for you right now and you can add the psychiatrist as needed or an appointment comes available.
The clinical psychologists at TGH are not taking new patients so I thought just as an experiment try the virtual one I sent you. His bio seemed interesting. It is totally up to you.

My thoughts:
We figured he would not respond in fact I think we spoke about that possibility last night. I think your prediction about Nevan’s father could be a stretch. If I were the father in this case and I knew my son’s brother-in- law was involved  on the opposite side I would steer clear.
My thought to you is to answer the questions your attorney asks you without commentary. A simple answer is all. She ask more questions if she needs more information. Your thoughts in this case are understandable but not necessary and may be misinterpreted in some cases.
My two cents…

No longer frustrating with that process or it happening in general. I have a plan and will take time.

Good Morning, Dad,

I finished the first draft of the music video. It’s in a zip file attached to an email I sent this morning. 

Super large File size means it will deliver through Google Drive. 

It may say it’s not accessible but there is a button to navigate towards downloading the zip. 

Let me know if you have trouble opening as I can send another way. 

The Audio quality sounds pretty solid, but it could sound better. I can adjust levels. Happy to make adjustments like bass, treble, etc. 

The audio in the video is just a slight enhancement from original recording quality. Let me know. Enjoy

Great! Glad you enjoyed. I’ll hold off on any adjustments. Don’t hesitate if you want a change. I can also share the audio only file. 

To play on the big screen, use a HDMI to HDMI for cabled connection then pick the input that matches. 

Or, I believe you have an Apple TV Black Box connected to the tv (or at least you used to). If so, from laptop click top right drop down on menu bar called “control center”…this has a “mirror screen” icon that looks like a square on top of another square . That will mirror your laptop to the TV

Hi dad, i didnt have a good opportunity late last night to talk to melissa about her calling. I left for the morning to start my day but melissa worked late so shes sleeping in. I dont want any uneasiness imposed and wil talk to melissa today as we have plans  this afternoon together but if she calls before then, you can choose to pick up or not pick up but just know she and i will talk this through without an issue i believe. I know how to best start the conversation after giving it some thought so we are all on the same team for the same cause. Thanks for everything. Shes an angel and even angels need some help so thats what im going to do

Ok
I want you to tell her that Mom and I are there for you both in so many ways and especially in any emergency. We feel you are on track to put the pieces back together and put Solar First behind you once and for all. How you handle your marriage and those very personal things is up to you. We hope…no we know… that your intuitive ability to handle your most personal issues are qualities that were instilled in you years ago. 
I’m here to listen anytime and to only offer my advice or opinion when asked. So ask away. 
Love you.
DaD
PS. between you and me …and don’t make it a big deal now but when you can - please ask Melissa that I would hope she could go back to calling me Cap or any other nickname and not Jeff.  It just doesn’t fit the family relationship that I feel as a Dad.
