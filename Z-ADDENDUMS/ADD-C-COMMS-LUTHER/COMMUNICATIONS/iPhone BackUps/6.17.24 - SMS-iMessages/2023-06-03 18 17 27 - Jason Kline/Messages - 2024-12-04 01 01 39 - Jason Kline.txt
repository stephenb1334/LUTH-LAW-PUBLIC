----------------------------------------------------
Jason Kline
2023-05-23 18:53:23 to Jason Kline - Delivered

She is Lbank. 

When you wired Lbank $50k, or whatever the amount it was, it didn’t go to Lbank, it went to her. “Her” is a criminal organization from china. They created an Lbank lookalike site. You can see the “EX” in the branding and domain used. They built a fake trading platform that looks like Lbank and they get people to create accounts and do the same. They code it so it feels like you’re conducting a transaction. And they have the type of security checks you’d expect like sending photo ID and passport which allows them to mimic actual financial institutions while also allowing them to gather even more information on their victims. 

They are using artificial intelligence to create fake videos and photos. Even if you hear a live voice, it’s fake. 

They gave you fake evidence in the form of a supposed Russian female with her pics and videos, but the mistake I caught shows they are Chinese and from china.
