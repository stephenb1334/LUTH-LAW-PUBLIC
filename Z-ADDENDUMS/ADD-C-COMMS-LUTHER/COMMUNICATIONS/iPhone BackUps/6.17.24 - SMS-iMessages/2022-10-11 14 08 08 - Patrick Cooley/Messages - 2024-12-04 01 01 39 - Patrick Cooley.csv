I’m the head coach of my daughters hockey team this year and the first practice is next week so I was hyper aware of the timing since none of us had any idea. There just needs to be some communication as we constantly get left wondering what’s going on ",,

I’ve had OOO on my calendar for 12th/13th for some time now and I’ve learned that if you don’t have blocks of time blocked off on your calendar they will only look at your PayIt meeting schedule and ask you based on that. I still got put on the spot on the Friday call but told Jeff and val from day one I wasn’t going to be able to go, and I’m traveling the week before and week after aamva. So I didn’t get tapped or pressured to go after I said no on team call. I dunno man. Shit show. I’m bout ready to bounce",,

Patrick Cooley,2022-09-07 16:00:07,2022-09-07 16:00:07,,,iMessage,Outgoing,,,Delivered,,,Curious what you meant by Charmed the shit out of MP. How’d you reach out? You talk to him?,,
Patrick Cooley,2022-09-07 16:03:26,,2022-09-07 16:04:00,,iMessage,Incoming,+14158865109,Patrick Cooley,Read,,,I was kind of joking about the charming part. I said the good news is that his whole RMD team gets along really well and collaborates but the bad news is that it has turned us into an unofficial labor union and it was my turn to reach out. I just asked to get that call back on the books and that we were all anxious to get this sorted since we feel good about our pipeline and don’t want things up in the air when they start closing.  ,,
