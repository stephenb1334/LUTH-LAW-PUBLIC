Hello, this is Steve re: the white board. I will be at Strafford train station at 11:30. Please meet me in the parking lot. I will get as close to the entrance stairs as I can. When you exit the train, you‚Äôll have to exit the platform, walk under the underpass and the parking lot to the platform entrance is right there

Hey Steve! Would we still be able to store the whiteboard in your garage for a bit longer?

The SEPTA woman didn‚Äôt let us bring it on the train, and the car is about 2 inches too small, so I think the best option is to come back when you‚Äôre free in a bigger car.

Hey Stephen, hope you had a great Thanksgiving! For a third (and hopefully last :) ) attempt at transporting this whiteboard, I‚Äôve found a cargo van courier service that should be able to pick it up. You should be able to just leave it outside of your garage in the morning and they'll take care of the rest. Would that work for you? If so, is there any particular day that wold work best?

Hi claire. I no longer live there day to day so I can‚Äôt return this week to place it out front. Can the service just open the garage door and take it?
