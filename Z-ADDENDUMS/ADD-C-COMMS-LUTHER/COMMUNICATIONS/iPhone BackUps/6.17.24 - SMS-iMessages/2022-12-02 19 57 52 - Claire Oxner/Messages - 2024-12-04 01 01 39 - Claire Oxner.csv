Please meet me in the parking lot. I will get as close to the entrance stairs as I can. When you exit the train, you’ll have to exit the platform, walk under the underpass and the parking lot to the platform entrance is right there",,

For a third (and hopefully last :) ) attempt at transporting this whiteboard, I’ve found a cargo van courier service that should be able to pick it up. You should be able to just leave it outside of your garage in the morning and they'll take care of the rest. Would that work for you? If so, is there any particular day that wold work best?",,
